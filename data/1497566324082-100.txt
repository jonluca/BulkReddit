Awesome Mix Vol 1 vs Awesome Mix Vol 2 - /u/dejerik
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hfp53/awesome_mix_vol_1_vs_awesome_mix_vol_2/
----------------------------------------

So the two Guardians Mixes are two that I love and have on my phone and have been listening to quite a bit. I find it interesting the differences between the two in listening to them. 

Awesome mix 1 feels a little peppier. Lots of fast moving fun songs. Awesome Mix 2 feels a little slower a little more thought out almost. I was interested in the songs themselves and their reception when they were on the radio so I quickly looked up their position relative to one another on the US top 100 billboard charts.

My results were interesting but not wholly surprising. Awesome Mix 1 has more songs that are higher on the top 100 charts, no songs dip out of the top 10 except only 2 songs that didnt make it into the top 100, "Cherry Bomb" by the runaways and "Moonage Daydream." Listening to those songs that isnt that surprising. Awesome Mix 2 however, 5 songs are in the top ten, and the rest are much further down.

I think this lends some credence to the idea that GotG 2 and awesome mix 2 is more personal to James Gunn himself, since the story seems more focused on the character rather than a mcguffin and the songs seem to be more Gunn's taste and less what some bad ass popular songs are. Totally pulling these conclusions out of my ass and would be interested in others takes on this. If these matter or if its totally off base.

Charts below with the break down.

Is anyone doing a complete rewatch of everything MCU before Infinity War? - /u/ender23

I'm curious if someone is setting this up.  like a movie or two episodes of tv a week, wonder how long it'll take.  Has the Sub ever done something like that to prep for a movie?  I'd like to review all my material before hand and hear everyone's thoughts. Hoping someone does it, but would be interested in working with some mods and stuff to set it up.   Is this something people would be interested in?  all movies and TV shows.

In the [Marvel Cinematic Wiki Timeline](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline), it separates the beginning and ending and has several things in between the two. Where does the beginning end exactly? I can't find that listed anywhere.

[Spoilers] Advanced Screening of "Spider-Man Homecoming" - /u/bby625704
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hbe84/spoilers_advanced_screening_of_spiderman/
----------------------------------------

Hello everyone, 
     I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening a couple of weeks back. My wife took me to see a "screening" of a movie that we thought was called "The Solutrean" which is a Sony film. However, when the lights went down and the Marvel Studios logo came up in addition to the Sony logo the cat was out of the bag! While I won't go into spoilers (I only put spoilers in the title to abide by the rules) I would be happy to answer any questions related to the overall film quality etc if anyone cares to ask them. 



[Spoilers] Who is playing THESE characters in Spider-Man Homecoming? Only enter if you want to know. - /u/bby625704
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hibos/spoilers_who_is_playing_these_characters_in/
----------------------------------------

Hey everyone. So In my last thread regarding seeing a screening a couple of weeks back, I was peppered with questions about two characters specifically. JJ Jameson and Mary Jane Watson. Are they in the film and if so WHO is playing them? If you read the thread, you'll see that while I was coy about MJ and if Zendaya is playing her, I did say that possibly the largest casting spoiler in the MCU was JJ and who's playing him. Well, I can also say that MJ IS in the film as well? Who's playing her? Maybe an even larger spoiler to the MCU. I will only be free for the next 30 minutes or so but later I'll hop on. This is for everyone asking me over and over. So don't get upset if you're unhappy with the reveals or if you're in disbelief. Call me a liar, Call BS whatever you want. But do me a favor and in three weeks, come back to this thread so we can talk.Are you ready? 



Ant-Man and the Wasp location/setting - /u/BuzzardOaks
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hhd8z/antman_and_the_wasp_locationsetting/
----------------------------------------

Do y'all think the movie will take place in San Francisco again or somewhere else. Honestly it was really nice to see big city that wasn't New York, it added another level of uniqueness. But with Scott Langs current situation I don't know if it would take place in SF



Cosmic Marvel Wish List - /u/belial77
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hi789/cosmic_marvel_wish_list/
----------------------------------------

Other than Nova, who do you want to see on screen? Either as supporting character in GoG, Capt Marvel or IW... or as a solo project?

I'd love to see Phylla Vell and/or Moondragon. Phylla's back story and the quantum bands would have to take liberties w/ the source material (no Quasar or Mar-Vell in MCU)... but think it could work.



What do you imagine the movies would have been like before the MCU? - /u/alientraveller
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hebnn/what_do_you_imagine_the_movies_would_have_been/
----------------------------------------

I've been imagining how Iron Man, Cap and Thor's trilogies would've turned out if they had been made when the rights were still scattered across different studios.

Before the MCU, superhero film trilogies seemed to follow a basic story arc of an origin story, a sequel where the hero briefly gives up (*Superman II*, *Batman Forever*, *Spider-Man 2*), and another where they get drunk on power (*Superman III*, *Spider-Man 3*, *X-Men: The Last Stand*). The MCU changed all that, although you could argue *Civil War* was the threequel where the hero turns arrogant. I imagine this is what we'd have wound up with if the films didn't intersect:

* IM1: Tony vs. the Mandarin.
* IM2: Tony loses control of his company to Stane, passes his suit to Rhodey to focus on regaining it.
* IM3: The Armor Wars.

* T1: It's basically a Viking film.
* T2: Thor has a dilemma over retiring to live as Dr. Donald Blake.
* T3: Thor becomes King of Asgard and pisses off every mortal politician and religious leader.

* CA1: I'm in two minds, would they have held off on bringing him to the present or fast-tracked it?
* CA2: A present-day Steve basically wants to die, but realises he can't pass on the shield when the old enemy who wasn't in the first one resurfaces.
* CA3: There's a new Cap in town (Burnside or Walker) so Steve has to forgo his identity to stop whoever's behind them.

Split in two? For examples will the Old(Ravengers) Guardians with Stakar Ogord be the focus of a film and the present Guardians with Star Lord continue as a separate franchise. James Gunn sounded like he was setting them up for a film.



[Spoilers] Question on Quill's appearance in IW & GotG3... - /u/goodnightshirt
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hi94t/spoilers_question_on_quills_appearance_in_iw_gotg3/
----------------------------------------

Is Star-Lord's iconic mask/helmet gone for good?  It broke in half during the final battle with Ego.  I realize it was written this way so that Yondu would have the opportunity to sacrifice himself by giving Peter the space suit.  I haven't seen this discussed anywhere and it has bugged me a little.  I hope the mask comes back.





Has anyone switched sides after the Civil War? - /u/IanMoone13
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hbxnd/has_anyone_switched_sides_after_the_civil_war/
----------------------------------------

I'm just curious, I was a hardcore Team Cap but after marathoning the movies I switched over to Team Iron Man; based solely on the arguments provided for the moral and ethical reasons and between the two Team leaders actions over the course of their individual and team movies. 

I just felt that Iron Man had the better argument where at times Captain America's wasn't for the most part even about the Accords but Bucky. Now the accords especially under Secretary Ross if we're following movie canon definitely need revisioning but given the unsanctioned Black Operations the Avengers under Captain America appeared to be running in countries without notification there could be a necessity scene from a public standpoint to them. 

Also it never sat well with me how quickly Captain America let Wanda and to a lesser extension Pietro onto the Avengers Team given what both of them had to do not just with the Ultron Incident but their joining and serving Hydra (admittedly for their won reasons). And Clint Barton who was so protective of Wanda especially after her mind control of his teammates given his past experience with forced mind control by Loki. Maybe if we had been shown a scene where she made amends or even apologized to Tony let alone Bruce that would have helped for me at least. Heck for that matter even a scene with her understanding why Tony had "locked me in my room" given what had just happened and how many people were baying for her blood. 


Edit: I just wanted to say thank you for the open and civil discourse that you/we have all been having it's fascinating to see peoples thoughts, ideas, and opinions!

I'm meaning the main characters, basically The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the heroes on the TV shows. Ghost Rider, Yondu and The Watchers are the ones I'm a little more interested in tbh

And I know Scarecrow is a DC character, but I think it's interesting to think about these characters reacting with him.

How would you feel if all the fighting in Infinity War was the Black Order vs the heroes, and Thanos only fighting in the third act or maybe the next movie? - /u/MA93

I'd see them as the main forces fighting at first. Maybe he doesn't fight until his henchman have already battled.

Also, who would you want the Black Order to face off with? If they were all fighting individually 



Being a big fan of the original spidey (Stan lee and Steve ditko's run in the '60s) I have to say I'd be pretty upset if the new film doesn't capture the unfortunate/sometimes sad, even, life of Peter Parker like the original trilogy did. Does anyone else agree? - /u/noahnierenberg

----------------------------------------

Just curious to hear some opinions. Let's say someone else gets their hands on the gauntlet. Who would Marvel give it to? And what scenario could it be?

Though the obvious "face of the MCU", I couldn't see it being Stark. Not a Guardian, either (sorry Nebula). I'll throw a guess for maybe T'Challa, Danvers (if she showed up), or even a villain like Loki.



Thor: Ragnarok speculation - /u/robbedragon
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hdjz9/thor_ragnarok_speculation/
----------------------------------------

So, with Ragnarok right around the corner, I've been researching ways they can spin this. We all know Marvel studios has been tossing around ideas to replace Thor and, it's safe to say we may lose some avengers in the infinity war so, I want to throw out some thoughts on possible outcomes. These are our speculation so not true spoilers to the movies but may contain comic spoilers so, don't read on if you're not wanting those ruined. Also, since the comics do feed into the movies, there is a potential for spoilers there.

1. Introduction of Angela: Angela is a complex character and a fairly recent addition to the Marvel universe. Her story ties in with Thor and Hel so, I could see them introducing her. Especially since her comic was more or less a one-shot and Marvel is struggling to keep her relevant. She also plays into the Guardians of the Galaxy so, even if she isn't a replacement for Thor in the Avengers, she has a place. I'd much rather see her than Jane Foster Thor.

2. Jane Foster picks up the mantle as Thor. This is a possible path that has already been done in the comics. I'll admit, I haven't read it so I'm not sure the full story, mostly because I don't want to accept it. I mean, if Marvel wants to cater to the female demographic with a female Thor, he does have a daughter with Jane Foster from back in the 70s. Makes more sense for a half-Asgardian descendant of the original God of Thunder to wield Mjolnir than a human who just rolled around in the sheets with him but, I digress.

3. Planet Hulk. Hulk's whereabouts have been a mystery since Avengers 2 ended and he was big and green when he left. There is a massive story arc about Hulk finding a planet of Hulk like creatures and settling down there to have a family. The look on his face and the fact he wears the World War Hulk armor makes me think Bruce Banner may no longer be in full control and we may see that going forward.

These are just a few speculations I have and, there are so many possibilities since the Avengers members tend to feed into everyone's stories. That being said, it you want to give your own insight, feel free. I'm all for open discussions.



GOTG vol 2 spoilers/ Infinity War disscussion: Does anyone think we will get better explanations for...? - /u/SPYRAL_super_hero
https://reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6hbdul/gotg_vol_2_spoilers_infinity_war_disscussion_does/
----------------------------------------

The Celestials in the MCU. So in the MCU they seem to be extremely powerful creatures but we don't know much about them. We don't know if they did feats from the comics like create the Eternals and that is my main idea for this post. Do you think they will elabrote on them in the MCU?. I liked Ego but do diffrent Celestials have diffrent powers. Is Eson stronger then Ego. We need these questions answered. Will it factor into Infinity War.
