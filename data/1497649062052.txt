The hug heard around the company. - /u/texasgunowner12

----------------------------------------

I was thrust a laptop by an angry exec early this morning with him complaining that his laptop had locked up again. Normally we have a ticketing system in place for any and all tech issues. However when an exec wants something he bypasses the system because of RHIP. So I go through the normal routine of diagnosis and through my efforts I see that the issue is simply bad ram. I replace the ram and take the unit back to the exec. 

He tells me he refuses to take the unit unless I have made 100 percent sure that everything that was wrong with it is fixed. Internally I wanted to punch this man but I held it in and simply asked him what other issues he was having and pulled out a notepad. He ran through a load of issues that all screamed "just run fkin ccleaner" to me and I took his unit back to my desk. 

After going through and cleaning out BS installed programs used literally once and never again and cleaning out junk data, I found that a folder in his roaming was reading 12GB but was hidden. I log in with my creds and enable viewing hidden or protected files and I see that the hidden folder was from 2014. Basically it was just a bunch of pictures and looked to be a temp folder created by one of the old programs I removed. Some kind of picture manager or some such. 

Normally when we see personal pictures on the machine we are supposed to delete them immediately. Now no one EVER does this as we are not that big of dicks in the IT dept. Plus this guy was an exec so I decided to just move the pictures to his desktop under a folder I created called Old Pics. 

I took the laptop to him and informed him of the pics telling him I left it up to him if he wanted them deleted or not. He thanked me for my time and I went back to work. 

About an hour later him and his wife, who had come up to join him for lunch, came over to my desk. He seemed very happy and she was crying. 

Now normally when I have nothing to do and a boss comes over, I stand up to greet them. Just the way I was raised I guess. I was not prepared for what followed and was totally shocked by the outcome. 

The lady wanted to thank me for finding the pictures and the exec reached out to shake my hand thanking me profusely before pulling me into a hug in front of the entire IT department. I awkwardly hugged him back and he let me go embarrassed. My eyes are wide flabbergasted and totally unprepared for this, extremely, out of character moment from this guy. 

Barely able to hold back the tears, his wife tells me that the pictures I recovered were thought to be lost. In 2012 their 4 year old son had died of lukemia and the pictures I recovered were taken right before his diagnosis at 3 years of age. Because of a  house fire a few years ago they thought they lost every last photo of their son. Apparently those were the photos I had recovered. 

His wife reached out to hug me and everyone in the IT department stared at their screens hard with puffy eyes as we were all not expecting this kind of emotional event today.

My boss came out of his office to personally thank me and forwarded an email chain to me ahead of a company wide email that the CEO sent out basically retelling the tale while naming me personally. He threw in words about striving for excellence and the unexpected results of every day excellence. 

I had to turn off my skype for business as the attaboys kept coming in one after the other. My boss told me to take my lunch early since the flood of messages was making it hard to do my job. 

EDIT: Post this before lunch one day, don't log into reddit for a bit, realize post went nuclear. RIP inbox. Thanks for the gold you 9 kind redditors. 



This one's a simple one, but I can't get it out of my head. - /u/marinojesse

I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.

A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were "Third-party software, hard of hearing."

I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs "yes" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.

She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.

As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.

Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.

I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.

It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, "fixing" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.

Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.

Obligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words. Seeing the response I've gotten from all of you has made this experience even better! You guys are an amazing community.

Another tale from the out of hours IT desk...

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** GOOGLE BING ISNT WORKING IS THE SYSTEM DOWN ??? ITS VERY IMPORTANT I USE THE BING

*Note: yes, caller actually said "the bing"*

**Me:** I'm sorry - can you confirm which system you're referring to as I'm unfamiliar with that

**Caller:** Google Bing! Really how can you not know this

**Me:** Google Bing is not a system we support out of hours nor in hours. This sounds like a mash up between two different search engines. What exactly is happening?

**Caller:** I need Google Bing to do my job! This is unacceptable. I can't find Google Bing anywhere on my PC. How dare you remove this! I need you to fix Google Bing immediately!

**Me:** May I remote in to take a look

<spend 5 mins setting up remote connection>

Turns out that caller had a shortcut on her desktop called "Google Bing" - this opened the Bing Search homepage in Google Chrome *shivers*. She'd accidentally changed the name of the shortcut from "Google Bing" to something else and hence could not find it.

**Me:** okay - that has been renamed now so you're good to go

**Caller:** next time don't mess around with my computer! I know you guys changed this, I'm not stupid! I have a certificate of proficiency in computering

**Me:** okay thanks for calling *click*

*Note: yes caller really said "computering"*

I died a little inside after taking this call.

I work Helpdesk for a retail store chain in the UK. I had a call from a store about a till drawer that wasn't opening after a transaction.

>me: Could you check that the till is plugged in to the back of the pc?

>user: Sure, one second.. (I hear him rummaging under the desk)

>user: yeah, It's plugged in

*The POS software occasionally forgets which COM port to operate for the till drawer*

>me: I'm just going to try to open the drawer manually. Can you stand back from the drawer so it doesn't hit you.

>user: haha, sure!

*I open up CMD and try to open the drawer*

    echo a> COM1

*... nothing*

    echo a> COM2

**UGHHHHH.. Thud**

>me: Hello? I heard something, did the drawer open?

>user: ...

>me: Hello?

*After around 20 seconds a woman picks up the phone laughing*
>user2: *User* had to go to the bathroom to clean his nose, the till drawer hit him in face and bust his nose. We'll call you back later!

Whenever I want to reach through the screen and smack a user, I'll always think back to this story and remember that it's possible.



"Don't bother sending a tech, I'll be dead by then" - /u/guitarsdontdance
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/28qemm/dont_bother_sending_a_tech_ill_be_dead_by_then/
----------------------------------------

So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.  The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.

Quite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as "snow on screen" or "no signal" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment. 

Now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on "video" or "hdmi" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.

So anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.

I spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc. 

Whatever.

Like I said, I've dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That's when he dropped this on me:

"Don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because I'll be dead by then.  I'm 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?"

I instantly felt bad.  I mean, I've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I'm in my mid-20's so honestly I can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.

So I spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.  

At that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).  

He was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.

So I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.

That's when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.

3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for "Mr. Smith".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really "made an old man happy again for once in a very long time".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.

I guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.

Anyway thanks for reading just thought I'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)

> Steve

Jack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when Boss forwarded this to me. I called him at his desk. "Hey Boss. I just got the email you forwarded me. You need me to send file XYZ for you?"

"Yes. Can you...can you send people files on facebook?"

"Yes, I can. But I'll have to use the computer Jack's been using, though. It's the only one that can access facebook."

"Right, right. I'll meet you in my wife's office."

I hung up the phone and launched a single .bat file on my desktop. it ran its commands and then deleted itself as I walked away.

*

I got to Boss' Wife's office a few minutes later. I smiled to her and Boss before crossing to the computer. "Give me a second to bring up facebook and then--" I turned the laptop around to face us and Boss's wife reached over, moving the mouse. The screen flared to life.

Boss stared. Boss' Wife gasped. A soft moan, followed by the neigh of a horse, emanated from the laptop. She frantically closed the video window...revealing a second window underneath it; a Bing search for "*best places to buy weed near me*". She closed that one, too...revealing Buzzfeed's "*10 signs you're over your job*".

As she slammed the laptop shut, Boss shook his head, red and shaking with anger. "How...How was that--I mean, I thought--WHO WAS USING THIS COMPUTER?" he roared.

Boss's wife shook her head. "Jack was using it about a half-hour ago..." As as if on cue, Jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand.

Boss's back was to him. "THAT KIND OF THING SHOULD BE BLOCKED!" He yelled at me, pointing to the laptop.

I nodded. "I agree. Jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects. That's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week, right?" I pointed to the door with my chin and Boss saw Jack. 

Jack blinked at Boss. He looked at me. He looked at the computer. Then back to me. I could see it dawned on him what was going on. "Y-you did something to my computer, didn't you?!" He demanded.

Of course I had. I had copied a hidden batch file onto Jack's desktop from a USB drive when I "fixed" his computer the other day. A file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him. Then, all it would need would be a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. The file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved...three of the most incriminating web pages Jack had ever visited on the computer. All it needed was a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. Granted, it wasn't entirely untraceable, but the only person who'd know what to look for was in this room, looking with as angry a face I could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence.

Boss's wife chimed in. She was, at least, slightly more computer-savvy than her husband. "No. Clickity didn't do anything. He just exited the...you know. The screensaver. Whatever was there must have been what you were...um...*working on* when you rushed out of the office for lunch." she glared at Jack and then addressed Boss. "He must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his *blatant* misuse of company property." 

I shook my head solemnly. "And I trusted you with this unrestricted computer, too, Jack. I even gave you your own email address for the company because I thought you'd be an asset. Clearly...clearly I was wrong." I tried my best to sound hurt.

Boss's Wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me. "Jack, I am rather upset that you'd do something like this. I hired you as a favor to your mother. And you can be certain she'll hear about this. Now go home."

Jack stood there, shaking. He probably had an idea of what I had done, but he'd have no way to prove it. "But...He...I..." He pointed at me wordlessly.

"GET OUT!" Boss yelled.

Jack burst into tears and ran from the room.

*

Now, as I write this, it's been four weeks since Jack was terminated. I "patched" the "security hole" from Spotify and the interns are listening to music again. I didn't give the spare desk key back to the office manager.  As for Jack...I saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother. He came and knocked on my door.

"Um...Clickity?"

I looked up and narrowed my eyes. "What."

"I just...I wanted to say I'm sorry for...for saying that stuff and...acting like I did..."

I blinked.

"...and...um...now that I've apologized, I was hoping you could tell my mom that I didn't really look up any of that stuff. You...You know you're the one who did it. Not me. I mean..." he took a breath. "I mean, I've learned my lesson...so..."

*Seriously?*

"Come on, Clickity. She's made me get another job...and she cut my allowance...COME ON!" He looked at me pleadingly. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Actually, not even almost.

I shook my head and went back to typing. Jack continued standing there, and after a few long moments I looked at him.

"You can go now."

And then he was gone.

Here's another tale from the out of hours hell desk... This gem happened a few days ago.

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** THE SERVER IS DOWN YOU NEED TO FIX THIS NOW

**Me:** Which server are you referring to?

**Caller:** THE SERVER!

**Me:** *okay...* what is it that you are trying to do?

**Caller:** TRYING TO ACCESS THE GOD DAMN SERVER

(yes, she was SHOUTING the entire time)

**Me:** Please can you stop shouting at me and tell me which server you are talking about or what it is that you are trying to do? <business we support> has many different servers for different things, I need to know exactly what isn't working?

**Caller:** HOLY CRAP THE SERVER ISN'T WORKING. THE. SERVER. ISN'T. WORKING. YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME.

(In the background I've already loaded up our server monitoring tools - no alerts)

**Me:** I've checked our monitoring, I'm not seeing any servers as being down. Which department are you calling from?

**Caller:** IRRELEVANT. FIX THE GOD DAMN SERVER NOW.

**Caller:** THE SERVER IS DOWN I CAN'T CALL <obviously not a valid number>

**Me:** Ma'am that number is 3 digits short of a valid number, that is why the call is not connecting.

**Caller:** LISTEN THE SERVER IS OBVIOUSLY DOWN. I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE CALL YOUR PEOPLE ABOUT THIS! *click*

A good answer for when you're pulled over. - /u/Psychofant

I hope you will forgive me for a third hand story, but I'm one of those evil developers, not a support per se. But I thought you'd enjoy this story anyway. So this happened to a colleague of a colleague:
 
**$Hero** - our hero. **$Cop** - A representative of our hard worked law enforcement agency.
 
So $Hero is happily speeding along in his car, running a few yellow lights a bit late, etc. Finally, the law catches up to him and pulls him over. Here's how the conversation went:
 
**$Cop**: Can I see your driving license, please?
 
**$Hero** (with smug grin): Certainly. Here it is, officer.
 
**$Cop** takes license back to motorcycle and speaks into radio.
 
**$Hero**: It's not going to help you any, though.
 
**$Cop** (with no reaction): What do you mean?
 
**$Hero** (with wider grin): The server you have to check it against is down.
 
**$Cop** (still no reaction): And why do you say that?
 
**$Hero**: Because I'm the guy they called to get on site and get it up again.
 
Our hero did not get a fine this time. Instead he got a police escort to his workplace.



Company-wide email + 30,000 employees + auto-responders = ... - /u/sfsdfd
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/420oan/companywide_email_30000_employees_autoresponders/
----------------------------------------

I witnessed this astounding IT meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization.

An employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment. She happened to discover and use an all-employees@org.edu type of email address that included everyone. And by "everyone," I mean every employee in a 30,000-employee academic institution. Everyone from the CEO on down received this lady's apartment inquiry.

Of course, this kicked off the usual round of "why am I getting this" and "take me offa list" and "omg everyone stop replying" responses... each reply-all'ed to all-employees@org.edu, so 30,000 new messages. Email started to bog down as a half-million messages apparated into mailboxes.

IT Fail #1: Not necessarily making an all-employees@org.edu email address - that's quite reasonable - but granting unrestricted access to it (rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one "not the CEO = not authorized" reply).

That wasn't the real problem. That incident might've simmered down after people stopped responding.

In a 30k organization, lots of people go on vacay, and some of them (let's say 20) remembered to set their email to auto-respond about their absence. And the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees@org.edu. So, every "I don't care about your apartment" message didn't just generate 30,000 copies of itself... it also generated 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 new messages. Even the avalanche of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of "I'll be gone 'til November" auto-replies.

That also wasn't the real problem, which, again, might have died down all by itself.

The REAL problem was that the mail servers were quite diligent. The auto-responders didn't just send one "I'm away" message: they sent an "I'm away" message in response to *every* incoming message... including the "I'm away" messages of the other auto-responders.

The auto-response avalanche converted the entire mail system into an Agent-Smith-like replication factory of away messages, as auto-responders incessantly informed not just every employee, but also *each other*, about employee status.

The email systems melted down. Everything went offline. A 30k-wide enterprise suddenly had no email, for about 24 hours.

That's not the end of the story.

The IT staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the auto-responders. They brought the email system back online, and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem, etc. And they addressed the notification email to all-employees@org.edu.

IT Fail #2: Before they sent their email message, they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one.

More specifically: they missed at least *two*.




How I quit after I got fired and unfired - /u/Blempglorf
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/621lif/how_i_quit_after_i_got_fired_and_unfired/
----------------------------------------

[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/61z2ns/how_i_got_fired_and_unfired_in_the_same_day/), I shared the story of how I got fired in a huff by someone who, to put it diplomatically, over-estimated his own authority - only for my termination to be rescinded by his manager a few hours later when she found out about it.  This one is the followup; set a year later, and is the story of how I finally ended up quitting that job. 

Cast of characters: 

* Me! I was a lead sysadmin at a very large telco, responsible for the email system at the corporate HQ. I was a contractor there, which will become relevant to the story later. 
 
* Jim (J in my last story)- an IT architect at a large telco. Jim was my primary customer contact until he flew off the handle and tried to fire me under circumstances that were dubious at best.  Jim was a pretty smart technical guy who was also a bull in a china shop who shouldn't have been allowed to work around other people. 
 
* Lynne (not in the previous story) - Lynne is the IT architect who I was assigned to work with after Jim screwed the pooch in my previous story. She was awesome, for reasons that will become clear soon. She reported to Jim, and utterly loathed him. 
 
* Marie (M in the previous story)- Jim's boss, the IT department manager. She unfucked everything after Jim fired me.     

In early 2000, I got a phone call at home from an IT recruiter. This wasn't uncommon at all - I had at one point or another interacted with half the sleazy recruitment agencies in my city.   This call was a little bit different.  It was from an in house recruiter for a tech company, a company that was one of the shining stars of tech where I lived, with a reputation for not only having solid technology in their market, but also being a great place to work. They were an honest-to-goodness "unicorn" (back before anyone called them that.)  The conversation went something like this: 

Recruiter: Hi Blempglorf, this is Recruiter with CoolTechCompany, how are you today?  
Me: Doing well, thanks, what can I do for you?
Recruiter: Blempglorf, I'm calling because Lynne gave me a copy of your resume, and suggested that I reach out to you about a position we have open.  

A bog standard HR introductory call followed, where I found out that they were looking for a lead Windows sysadmin for their internal IT department. 

Now this confused the shit out of me, because Lynne was my lead, albeit through a dotted line.  Let that sink in: my boss sent my resume to a recruiter without my knowledge or permission.  Obviously, this was something that warranted further investigation. 

So, I called Lynne. Apparently, she had just interviewed at CoolTechCompany, and didn't get the job.  On the "thanks but no thanks" call from HR, she told the recruiter something to the effect of "Well, that's too bad, but I know someone else you need to talk to.  Blempglorf is better at this stuff than me, and I think he'd love working at CoolTechCompany." And then she sent over my resume, which she had from when she referred me for an internal hire job in another division of the telco we both worked at. When I asked her why she did that she just said: "You have to trust me on this one. I can't say more." 

So I had a phone interview with the hiring manager at CoolTechCompany. And he and I meshed well, and he decided to bring me in for the full gauntlet interview with the rest of the sysadmin team there. 

Around this time, I got a meeting request from Jim, who I hadn't really interacted with a lot since the time he tried (and failed) to shitcan me.  At the meeting, Jim informed me that Telco had decided to insource all the contract sysadmins, and bring them on as direct Telco employees.  He had an offer letter waiting for me at the meeting. I opened the offer letter, only to discover that it was a 20% pay cut from what I was earning as a contractor, to do the same job.  There was a slight bump in terms of benefits value (from what I recall the 401k match was superior) but at first glance, it was obvious that this was a pay hit no matter how you added it up.  Jim also informed me that this wasn't optional, that the insourcing was going to happen whether I liked it or not, and that this was a "take it or leave it" offer. Not only would this be a pay cut, but I would also be reporting directly to Jim, as would all the other newly-insourced sysadmins on the team.  Either one of those would be dealbreakers, but I kept my mouth shut, knowing his history. 

I caught up with Lynne a few minutes later. She took one look at my face and knew what had just happened. "This is why I told you to trust me." she said, before I even said a word. 

I could have kissed her. 

So, a couple of weeks later I went in for the full interview at CoolTechCompany, which resulted in an offer that would have been a no brainer to accept even if I hadn't just had my pay cut. I received that offer just before the planned effective date of the insourcing (and pay hit.)

The next day, I walked in to Lynne's cube and let her know that I'd gotten the job. She got this look of utter delight on her face, and said to me: "You HAVE to let me be there when you tell Jim."  So, we walked over to his office together, and told him.  He looked absolutely floored, and as usually did when he didn't get his way, immediately went into argument mode. 

"All the other sysadmins took the job." (True, but two others quit within the first two months because they didn't have the headstart on their job search that I did)
"You're making a big mistake"  (And why would that be?)
"Do you think that little company is going to last?"  (They did.)

The problem was that because of the planned insourcing, there was no mechanism to continue to pay me past the end of that week, as Telco's contract with the outsourcer was expiring. Enter Marie. Marie was Jim's boss, who I had a great relationship with. Now, I felt genuinely bad about this, because IT operations at corporate HQ was her responsibility, and this left her with not only no email server support, but only a day to figure out how to ensure continuity. (My backup had quit for unrelated reasons a month before.) I was perfectly willing to give 2 weeks notice per custom, mind you - they just didn't have a straightforward way to pay me for it. 

So, Marie called me into her office, after Jim had left for the day. I told her that I was already in the interview process at the time Jim gave me the offer (This was true, although I left out the whole part about Lynne.), and the fact that it was such a big pay cut made it a no-brainer to continue the process. Marie had an utterly stunned look on her face, and she said to me: "Pay cut?  You all were supposed to be kept at parity."  

What I found out later (through my mole Lynne) was that Jim neglected to relay that instruction to company HR when they were preparing the offer letters.  They prepared the offers at what HR deemed to be market rate, which in this case was a substantial pay hit. I never found out if he did that on purpose, but given that he'd complained in the past that he thought we were overpaid for what we did, I'd be willing to hazard a guess that he did.  

Anyway, even though Marie upped the offer to match my current pay rate (so much for take it or leave it) and promised that I'd be reporting to her given my past history with Jim, I still declined as my new job had a lot more long term opportunity.  I ended up taking the job at the telco, just long enough to work out my notice period. HR was *VERY* confused at my exit interview when they noticed that I'd been with the company for only 9 working days. 

Incidentally, I ended up staying at CoolTechCompany for over 8 years. It was the best career move I ever made. My only regret about it was that I was never able to get Lynne a job there.  On the other hand, Marie stepped in and took away all of Jim's supervisory responsibility over the sysadmins, sticking him in a strict technical role.  He lasted a few months after that and bailed out to a much smaller company. 



You deleted all my files! - /u/thedarkavengerx
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/65cam1/you_deleted_all_my_files/
----------------------------------------

Hey everyone, thought I would share this tale from one of my IT buddies. He had this one woman that would always puts tickets in for the smallest things. But this one takes the cake.

People:  
IT - IT Buddy  
CW - Confused Woman  

IT saw a ticket had come in and it was from CW. It said: "You deleted all my files! I need them to do my job!" IT called CW to see what was going on because we don't delete personal files off of people's computers unless there is a good reason for it and we have the user's permission. So while he was on the phone, he remotes into her computer and noticed everything but the recycling bin was missing on her desktop. He noticed that there was files in the recycling bin, so he opened it and all her files are there.

>IT: Here are all your files, did you move them into here?

>CW: Yes I did, I moved them in here to recycle them so they will be clean for me to work on them.

>IT: .....Excuse me?

>CW: Yes, I move them to the recycling bin to make them new again so I can reuse the files.

>IT: This is the trash bin, you would move files here to delete them off of your computer.

>CW: IT IS NOT A TRASH CAN, IT IS A RECYCLING BIN! IT SAYS SO RIGHT UNDER THE ICON!

So for the next half hour, my buddy had to teach her how to use the recycling bin.



OK, now the password is 'D35p41r' - /u/Bombadils

----------------------------------------

First post in quite some time! I work at a local authority on the helldesk. Social workers are the bane of my existence but you learn to cope with their general incompetence as part of the job. But sometimes they can still surprise you. This happened today.

So, we use a generic username for most of our computers so that people can log onto the machine, then from there they log into Citrix to work. Everyone knows the username and password for this. It's literally written on the walls in most areas, because the only thing it can access is another login page, so it isn't a security issue. Most of these accounts stay logged on at all times to save confusing the geniuses that work here. A guy rang up, said hello and asked for the generic login details. I've changed the exact username and password but other than that this is more or less word for word:


>**Genius**: So what's the username?  

>**Me**: It's 'Computer'.  

>**Genius**: so is that the asset number of the PC?  

>**Me**: Nono, it's just the word 'Computer'  

>**Genius**: And then backslash my name?  

>**Me**: NO. It's the word 'Computer.' C-O-M-P-U-T-E-R. Computer. nothing else.  

>**Genius**: And what's the password?  

>**Me**: It's 'P4ssword'. As in, the word 'Password' with a capital 'P', but you replace the 'a' with a '4'.  

>**Genius**: So it's 'Password4'?  

>**Me**: NO. It is not. It is 'P-4-s-s-w-o-r-d' With a capital P at the beginning. Everything else is lower case.  

>**Genius**: Ok, so the username is ComputerP4ssword. What's the password?  

>**Me**: NO. The username is Computer. The password is 'P4ssword'. That's everything. Just two words. Two boxes, two words.  

>**Genius**: *type type type* It didn't work. I typed in 'password' but it said it's incorrect.  

>**Me**: Spell out what you typed for me please.  

>**Genius**: 'p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d'  

>**Me**: *very slowly and clearly, in case it was my accent or something* ... Like i said. CAPITAL P. NUMBER FOUR. LOWER CASE S, LOWER CASE S, LOWER CASE W, LOWERCASE O, LOWERCASE R, LOWER CASE D. P4ssword.  

>**Genius**: *type type click* Nope. And it says the account is locked. I used a capital P this time definitely.  

>**Me**: did you use a 4 instead of the a?  

>**Genius**: Use four whats?  



I remoted to the machine and typed it in for him. He complained that the system was needlessly complicated.



How to fix a laptop that won't boot in under a minute - /u/brenkelieshere

----------------------------------------

Last year, Help Desk got a call from a user complaining that the laptop we issued him would not read DVDs.  He was one of those "I'm a very busy and a very important man, and I don't have time to follow your troubleshooting steps over the phone.  Just fix it, dammit." kinda guys, so he said he would get someone to drop off the laptop at our office and pick up a loaner.

&nbsp;

We received the laptop a couple days later, there was a note attached saying that now it wasn't even booting into Windows anymore.  Sure enough, he was right - it didn't even attempt to load Windows, and instead we were greeted by the "Non-system disk or disk error" message.  It sounded and looked like the PC was trying to boot from the DVD drive instead of the HDD.

&nbsp;

We opened the disk tray, and saw the culprit.  There was a DVD in there, all right - but it was placed upside down.

&nbsp;

We flipped the disc over. 

&nbsp;

He was trying to watch "Dumb and Dumber".



HR managers HATE this one trick - /u/Regs2
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5t2swq/hr_managers_hate_this_one_trick/
----------------------------------------

Every office has their special users.  The ones who can't figure out anything technical, everything is an emergency, and everything has to function exactly the same or they can't work.  At my job, it is the HR lady.  Since she is just HR, all her problems boil down to a printer error, excel, word, reboot and it works type of issues, and since I am the System admin they are all my responsibility.  

However, every issue she has she comes back to IT, walks right by my desk goes to the programmer, manager, network admin and explains the issue.  Every time they either tell her to go me (even though she gets bitchy), or relay the info to me to fix.  

A few weeks back, she had a problem with the calculations on an excel spreadsheet.  Everyone was at lunch, so she's forced to ask me.  Immediately, I say it is probably rounding up or down because it is only off by a penny.  This doesn't suffice, so she ignores me and waits until lunches are done to return.  She goes to programmer guy and like usual, he passes it to me.  I email her with a breakdown showing how it is rounding.  She still wants programmer guy to look at it, so my manager responds with a message saying he will get to when he can.

Well, programmer guy is swamped, the new website launch is getting pushed out, her excel "problem" gets shelved with her emails coming ever more frequent.  My manager even resends my explanation, but she wants programmer guy to look at it.  This is unacceptable, so she goes to the VP saying we aren't helping her.  

My boss sets up a meeting with the 3 of us for me to explain the issue.  It was the shortest meeting ever because I start explaining it and our VP completely understands right away.  The VP cuts me off, looks at HR lady and says "You pulled me into a meeting for this shit?"

TLDR; HR lady with easy issue ignores obviously solution only to be burned by VP.

It's 11:30 pm and I get a call through from my least favourite business we support (we have no systems access and very little in the way of documentation, their calls are renowned for being a pain in the ass to deal with).

EA = Extremely affluent sounding British guy

**Me:** Service desk how can I help?

**EA:** Oh hello I'm not able to print

**Me:** Okay, any error messages? Any signs of life from the printer?

**EA:** Now hold on I'm not a computer person so you'll need to use simple terms

**Me:** What happens when you print?

**EA:** Nothing happens that's why I'm calling you!

**Me:** Do you see any messages appear on the screen when trying to print?

**EA:** No

*I have a particularly low tolerance for these kinds of callers who are unable to provide even basic details. This guy was also coming across as very condescending*

**Me:** Is your printer turned on? Can you see any lights?

**EA:** Of course!

**Me:** Can you walk me through what you generally do to print something?

**EA:** I'm not a computer person so you'll need to be more clear

**Me:** Tell me how you'd usually print

**EA:** Look here, I don't really understand what you're asking me

**Me:** What would you usually do to print?

**EA:** I don't understand you

**Me:** Ok sir, I'd like to connect remotely to your computer so I can see what's on the screen. Is that okay?

**EA:** This is all very complicated. I'm not sure what you want to do.

**Me:** I'd like to access your computer so I can see what's wrong

**EA:** I'm sorry, can you explain that more clearly?

**Me:** I'm not sure how much clearer I can actually be with this. I need to remotely connect to try and fix this for you

**EA:** Look this is terribly unfriendly for people who aren't technically savvy like myself. Why can't you fix this?

**Me:** I'm trying to help you and fix it but you haven't been able to provide a great amount of detail on the issue, so I'd like to remotely connect a take a look myself

**EA:** I'm not familiar with these technical terms. This is very hard. I don't understand why we have you people if you can't help people who aren't technically savvy

**Me:** I'm trying to help, however as it's out of hours our scope is limited. I need to remotely connect to see what's going on. I respect that you are not technically savvy but at the same time we do expect a certain level of existing knowledge from users in order to be able to provide our support service after hours. I can ask that the main service desk calls you back in the morning if you'd prefer? 

**EA:** No look this is very important and I need this fixed, how do you get on my screen?

**Me:** Firstly, I need you to open a web browser or just go to Google

**EA:** I JUST USE THIS FOR EMAIL WHAT ON EARTH IS A WEB BROWSER?

**Me:** Do you use Google?

**EA:** Yes of course I do!

**Me:** Okay, please go to Google....

*we spend a painful amount of time getting gotoassist working*

**Me:** Thank you I'm now connected. I'm going to take a look at the printer setup now

**Me:** I see the printer is reporting "not connected". Can you check to make sure it's plugged in please?

*I Google the model number and this is an old-ass Epson printer. USB only. At this point I've had enough of this callers ineptness*

**EA:** But I don't know HOW!

**Me:** I'm sorry, I really can't help you with this part. You're the one physically located with the computer and the printer. Go to the printer and make sure any wires coming from it are plugged into the PC.

**EA:** OK. 

*Several minutes later I hear the unmistakable sound of a device being connected in Windows*

**Me:** Okay, the printer is now showing as connected so it looks like the plug was disconnected. Please try printing again.

*EA navigates to Outlook, opens an email about discounted camping products and proceeds to print it off*

**Me:** I can hear the printer in the background so it looks like we're good now?

**EA:** Yes it's working but you didn't help me at all *click*

EA was such a PITA. He also left gotoassist running in the background - so I spent the next half an hour inconspicuously moving his mouse each time he tried to click something before I got bored and disconnected.





I know IT better than IT - /u/airzonesama
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5tkwz1/i_know_it_better_than_it/
----------------------------------------

So a few years back, I was working in a manufacturing company as IT manager. Like many industries, we had a number of machines with embedded computer systems. For the sake of convenience, we called these "production machines", because they produce stuff. By and large, these PC's are just normal desktop PC's that have a bunch of data acquisition cards in them connected to a PLC, or a second network card connected to an ethernet capable PLC. Invariably these PC's are purchased and configured when this production machine is being commissioned, and then just left as is until the production machine is retired... In some cases, this can be as long as 20 years. Please bear in mind that this is 20 years inside a dusty, hot factory environment.


I've been in manufacturing environments before, and this concept is not new to me. Thanks to a number of poignant lessons in the past, I make it my business to understand these PC's inside and out. I like to keep them on a tight refresh cycle, or when it's not practical (in the case of archaic hardware or software), keep as many spares as possible. Also, regular backups are important - you just have to understand that unlike a normal PC, it can be difficult to do and plan it well in advance. More often than not, these PC's aren't IT's responsibility - they fall under engineering or facilities. Even so, these guys understand that IT runs just about every other PC in the business, and welcome any advice or assistance that IT can provide. Finally, these PC's are usually tightly integrated into a production machine, and failure of the PC means the machine stops.


And so we have today's stars:

Airzone: Me, the new IT manager. 

TooExpensive: The site's facilities manager. He's in charge of the maintenance of the site, including all of these production machines. He's super paranoid about people trying to take his job, so he guards all his responsibilities jealously and doesn't communicate anything lest they get the drop on his efforts. Oh, and he has a fixation about not spending company money - even to the point of shafting the lawn-mowing guy out of a few hours pay - hence the name.

VPO: Vice president of operations. The factory boss. No nonsense sort of guy.

OldBoy: We'll get to him, but his name is derived from being a man in his 70's.


I'm new, but in my first few weeks I've already had a number of run-ins with TooExpensive. I'm a fairly relaxed guy, but I have no qualms about letting someone dig their own grave and fall into it - and in the case of TooExpensive, I'd be happy to lend him my shovel. My pet hate was when organising new network drops, I will always run a double when we needed a single. We're paying working-at-heights money already, and a double drop is material cost only. i.e. Adding $50 - $100 material on a $4000 single drop cost. He'd invariably countermand all my orders and insist on singles. And then a few weeks / months later, I'd have the sparkie in again to install the second drop, at another $4k.

And then there was the time that he was getting shirty because I was holding up a project of his.. Well sorry, if you are running a project that requires 12 - 16 network ports, you'd better at least talk to the IT guys prior to the day of installation. Not only will you not have drops, you won't have switch ports. And if you didn't budget for them, or advise far enough in advance that I could, then you can wait until I get around to it. Failure to plan is not an emergency.

So you could see that we didn't exactly gel together well.

Which brings us to these production machines, and the PC's nested within. Every attempt for me to try and document, or even understand  them was shut down by TooExpensive. 

> *Me*: Hardware and software specifications? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. 

> *Me*: Startup and shutdown procedures? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. 

> *Me*: Backup? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.

> *Me*: Emergency contacts? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.


You get the picture. It resulted in a strong and terse email from TooExpensive to leave it alone. He had all the documentation, contacts, backups, and didn't need, or want my meddling, and I was not to touch any production machine's PC under any circumstance.

Move forward a few months and I'm helping one of the factory workers on their area's shared PC. It's located right next to one of these production machines. It's old. The machine itself was nearly an antique, but the controls system had been "recently" upgraded. It had co-ax network of 2 PC's - one NT4 primary domain controller, and a NT4 workstation, and a network PLC (also on co-ax). The machines were pentiums running the minimum specs for NT4 to run, with a control application whose application logic was configured entirely through a propriety database. I had actually seen this software in a different company, so I had some basic familiarity with it. The co-ax was terminated on a hub with a few cat5 ports on it to connect to our LAN and an old hp laserjet printer. These particular production machines are rare, only a few of them exist in the world. We bought this one from a company that had gone out of business a few years earlier.

It was test&tag day and TooExpensive was running around a sparkie to do the testing. My earlier instruction to the sparkie was to not disconnect any computer equipment if it was not powered off. And so it came time to test this production machine's PC. The sparkie wasn't going to touch it while it was on. Luckily TooExpensive came prepared with his thoroughly documented shutdown procedure: yank the power cords. The test passed, new labels were applied to the power cord, he plugged it back in and turned it back on, then ran off to his next conquest without waiting for the boot to finish.

10 minutes later, the machine operator starts grumbling. I have a quick peek, and see that the control software had started, but the screen was garbled and none of the right measurements were showing. TooExpensive is called over, and he talked one look, pales, and then runs off. 

10 minutes later, the operator looks at me and asks for help. I call TooExpensive's mobile, and it's off. I called VPO's mobile and suggest that he comes over immediately.

10 minutes later, the operator, VPO, and I are looking at this machine. It's fucked. There's the better part of a million dollars worth of product to be processed by this machine, and the nearest alternate machine is in Singapore, belonging to a different company. And if the processing isn't done within soon, the product will expire and be scrapped. 40% of revenue is from product processed by this machine. We're fucked.

10 minutes later, we still can't get onto TooExpensive. We can't talk to him about the "backups" or any emergency contacts that he knows about. We can't even get his phone to ring.

So as I have said, I have used this software before and have a basic understanding. I know enough that the configuration is everything, and configuration is matched to the machine. But I also knew a guy who did some of the implementations. A call to him gave me a lead, and I followed the leads until about 4 calls later, I had the guy who implemented this particular machine. OldBoy had retired 10 years earlier, but VPO had persuaded him to come out of retirement for an eyewatering sum of money.

A few hours later, OldBoy took one look at the machine and confirmed that the database was fucked. We'd need to restore it from backup. TooExpensive is still not contactable.

> *Me*: Let's assume for a moment that there is no backup. What do we need to do.

> *OldBoy*: Normally I'd say pray, buy you must have done that already because I haven't kicked the bucket yet.

To cut a long story short, we had to rebuild the database. But not from scratch. OldBoy's MO was when setting up a machine, when he was done, he'd create and store a backup database on the machine. The only issue was that 20 years of machine updates needed to be worked out. It also just so happens that through sheer effort, I am able to compare a corrupted database file to a good one, and fool with it enough to get it to load in the configuration editor. It's still mangled, but we are able to use that as a reference to build the lost config. 

All up, it took 4 days to bring this machine back online. But we did. To be honest, I certainly wasn't capable of doing this solo, and without my efforts to patch the corrupted database file, OldBoy would not have been able to restore 20 years of patches that we had no documentation for.

And what of TooExpensive?

After OldBoy and I started working on the problem, he showed up again. He ignored any advice about a backup (because obviously there wasn't any), and instead demanded regular status updates for him to report to VPO. The little shit had screwed up the machine, run off to hide, and now a solution was in progress, was trying to claim the credit.

When it was all running again, OldBoy debriefed VPO on the solution. I then had my turn with VPO.

> *VPO*: So Airzone. Thanks for your help. Your efforts have un-fucked us. 

> *Me*: No worries.

> *VPO*: And now we get to the unpleasant bit. TooExpensive claims that you didn't follow procedure when shutting down the machine, causing it to crash. He also claims that you hadn't taken any backups, and it was effectively your fault.

> *Me*: And when we tried to call him?

> *VPO*: He claims he was busy contacting his emergency contacts.

> *Me*: I see.

> *VPO*: I don't believe a word of that shit. Unfortunately it's your word vs his. If I had the evidence, I'd fire him.

> *Me*: *(opening the email TooExpensive had sent me about meddling on my phone)* You mean this evidence?


Half an hour later, I got the call to lock TooExpensive's account and disabled his access card.


Edit: Wow, this story seems to have resonated with so many people here..  And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!



Modern Warfare needs 1TB of RAM... - /u/WMTaylor3
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/68znnq/modern_warfare_needs_1tb_of_ram/
----------------------------------------

Hi all, mandatory LTL, FTP. On mobile so formatting will be a bit sketchy and disclaimer, not in Tech Support but hopefully will be eventually after completing my Comp-Sci degree.

Was in a TeamViewer session with a colleague but 10 brief minutes ago when I discovered to my distaste that his 2TB HDD was filled to the brim as was his 120GB SSD. Upon inquiring what was using such immense portions of precious digital real-estate, I was met with the standard "I'm not sure, it's always been like that. I just delete stuff when it's too full to function." Type response...

Enter WinDirStat to save the day. For those of you unaware, this little app displays the contents of your drives in a graphical layout, with the size usage of each file proportionately scaled to the others.

Normally one can expect a large block of medium sized files, some downloaded videos, a few steam games, but never in my years have I opened the application to find one GIANT M**********ING MONSTROSITY of a block consuming well over half the poor 2TB drive, barely leaving other little files to squeeze in around the edges, clawing desperately for some left over 1's and 0's to call home.

The seasoned among you will already have guessed, but this file was none other than the villain of the piece, the dark and shady 'pagefile.sys'. Our hero (yours truly) swam through the dark recesses of the system configuration in search of the settings pane that would confirm my hunch, all the while my colleagues eyes growing wider with understanding and guilt. Eventually I found it. The page file options were set to 'Manual Configuration', and that manual configuration was a default size of 1TB, with permission to expand to 1.2...

My colleague offered an explanation for his actions. Apparently some four years ago he fancied himself a game of Modern Warefare and was displeased to find it kept crashing. Rather than just quit some background applications or buy some more memory, he decided the best solution was to boost his page file size. First a GB, no good. Maybe 2GB. No dice. Eventually he must have just opted for 1 followed by a random amount of zeros, happening to be an entire TB.

Years passed and he didn't notice the change day to day as the page file gradually grew fatter, gorging itself on any scraps of excecutable it could find. Slowly expanding to occupy 1.2TB of his total 1.8. and that... Is how he has lived... Without question... For 4 years.

A page file size drop and reboot later and he was a happy camper, and I had my first TFTS post.

TL;DR: Friend wanted to play a game, lacked sufficient RAM. Sacrificed most of 2TB HDD to the page file gods as an eternal offering.

EDIT: Wow, this blew up overnight, thanks for making it a good first post all! :) Also, I've seen a lot of people ask why I'm doing Comp-Sci for tech support/wanting to go into tech support in the first place. Truth is I oversimplified things, I didn't think it was relevant but the specifics are, I'm doing a bachelor of Information Science, with a double major in Computer Science and Information Technology. Because, honestly I don't know specifically what I plan to do after graduating, just that I love IT and want to do something in that field. As for why tech support... After reading this sub-reddit, it sounds like it should keep me entertained!

A call comes in, a user reports her keyboard is going erratic, it is "possessed." I take a stroll down to the office bearing a new replacement keyboard. 

I get there and I begin to make sure that it is indeed a faulty keyboard, and not just some gunk sticking the key down. I open up notepad and immediately I am barraged by "...nnnnnnn..." Everything seems fine otherwise, this keyboard is the same model as the replacement I brought over, so relatively new, no sticky keys either. Very well a faulty keyboard it is. Until...

...Until I move the tower and notice a second, wireless keyboard sitting on the side of it, laying flat on the floor, with a stack of papers and a tissue box sitting atop. I pull it out and notice the n barrage has stopped on the screen. I press the N key once again and an n is added to the word file.

Get the scripts before you fire your IT - /u/Theallmightyadmin
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4x2wco/get_the_scripts_before_you_fire_your_it/
----------------------------------------

 I was working for a large warehouse and customization company under contract through another company and recently they had been talking about cutting people and shifts to make up for the lack of sales during the summer and wanted us to show our worth. 

 The IT manger asked me since I was the last hire to show my worth and why I should not be cut. 80% of what I had to do in the first 3 months I had gotten down to simple scripted fixes by talking to the software vendors and learning the fixes. Plus reduced turn around time on broken RF guns by actually looking at how to repair them and which of the parts from the old guns being replaced were compatible with the new models. 

 I presented all of this to him and the following week I was notified by my contract manager they were letting me go. Fine with that really as seasonal was coming up and the no drug test or background check hires were the worst each year. Two days later I get a call from the manager demanding the scripts I used. While at the job they never provided me with any tools and they told us to use our own if we needed it. I had never put the scripts on the server or on my work computer. I check my contracts for any clause for files or documents I create while on the job and then proceeded to tell him they were not worth me keeping my job, so I deleted them when requested to dormat my drive upon termination, but they could keep my screwdriver set in my drawer so they can have one in the office.

For those who cant keep up.
Scripts were made on my own time off the clock talking to software vendors cause they are closed during  my night shift. Never left my USB drive. Was deleted per request for my drive being formatted on termination. I was a contractor and the scripts would belong to my contract company and not the company I was sent to if any and they already said they dont want them I am safe. (They dont make money if I am not there)

It work for a small IT company providing website, email servers and web software.  

**the interlocutors :**  
> $Me : Your dearest  
> $Boss : Boss of client company  
> $Mom : Co-Boss of client company and also $Boss's Mother  

After few year of collaboration with $Client our accountant come to me saying that $Client haven't pay the monthly fee for their website and mail server.  
*Sometime clients forget to set up automatic transfer when they change bank or their accountant went on vacation and forgot to tell someone to do it*  
So i call then to know what append :  

> $Me: Hi, it's $Me from $IT we havent received your transfer from last month. Is there a problem ?  
> $Mom: I don't know what are those fee. I won't pay for it.  
> $Me: These fees are for your website and your mail server.  
> $Mom: We don't use it. I don't want it. I won't pay for it *Click*  

*Okay! You do not have to be this rude.*  
So we send a registered letter with recorded delivery saying that if they do not pay until the end of next month we will have to shut down all their service.  

After a month and a little bit, still no transfer, we shut off everything.  
Sure thing 30 minutes later we receive a call from $Boss.  

> $Boss: My emails stopped working you have to fix this please.  
> $Me: Yes we shut of your server because you haven't paid your monthly fees for the last two months.  
> $Boss: What ? But $Mom is in charge off all the suppliers, she should have paid you.  
> $Me: No, she told us that you did not need our services and did not want to pay for it.  
> $Boss: She is crazy! We take care of all our invoices and contracts by emails. Without them we may as well close the company. I will take care of paying you personally from now on. But please start the server back on.  

So we did and 20 min later one of his employee was at our door with a check for last two month and the upcoming one. And from this point he always paid us in time.

Ever try to tech support someone with their equally technologically challenged husband/wife behind them telling them what to do?

Okay, a scam email. No big deal, just tell the Cx and we can move on.

>Me: That's not real. It's most likely a virus.

>Wf: No let's take a look

Please don't. 

>Me: I really wouldn't do that

>Cx: It's okay. We're just going to look and not download anything

>Wf: Maybe it's from the mall!

No it's not.

>Cx: okay we're just going to take a quick look

>Wf: Wow a free ipad! I can't believe it! We won!

No you didn't.

>Wf: Click on it!

No really please don't. Please.

>Cx: okay let's see how to redeem our ipad from apple

It's not from apple. you're not getting the ipad. You're getting a virus.

*15 seconds later I hear the "your computer has a virus" message playing from their speaker*

> Cx: Our computer just got a virus. Can you fix this? Can you remote in and fix this?

No.

> Wf: I can't believe people would do that! 

And I can't believe people still falls for it.

*Cue two hours of babystepping them through running Malwarebyte because we aren't allowed to hang up on stupid.

Edit: it's the fake blue screen of death scareware piece of shit that auto plays the audio clip. It comes with pop ups. It tells you to call a number to get it fixed, you click on it and you get even more malware. That's what the free iPad linked them to.

So, I had to walk a client through setting up a printer over the phone. Which required her to set an IP address to the printer. Also she is not tech smart at all. 

Me: "Ok, do you have a usb cable? Sometimes they come with the printer"

Her: "No, im looking in the box now. Theres no usb cable. Only the printer and power"

*So it needs to me networked, great. I walk her through getting the printer on her network*

Me: "Ok, do you see a place to enter 4 numbers?"

Her: "Yep, its right here"

Me: "Ok the number is 192.168.0.3"

Her: "Ok, I put in 19216803. Whats the 2nd number?"

Me: "No, lets start over. The first number is 192, second is 168, third is 0, and fourth is 3"

Her: "Ok, so 192.168.03?"

Me: "No, the third number is just 0, the fourth is 3"

Her: "So, 0.0.0.3?"

Me: "no, 192.168.0.3"

Her: "But what about the 0?"

Me: "What about it?"

Her: "Shouldn't it be a number?"

Me: "0 is a number"

Her: "Look this it to complex for me, cant we just use the cable it came with?"

Me in my head: WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOU HAD A CABLE!?!??! YOU SAID YOU JUST HAD THE PRINTER AND POWER CABLE!

Me: ".....yes"

Edit: I should say, this is the shortened version. IRL this conversation went on for 30 min and this ticket lasted 2 days. 

Edit2: I said "Zero", NOT "o" and I said both "period" and "dot"



5:45AM call from "friend of a friend" for tech support. WTF? - /u/DallasITGuy
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3ph80l/545am_call_from_friend_of_a_friend_for_tech/
----------------------------------------

I'm sitting here stewing in my own juices. Damn home phone (which I keep because the security system uses) started ringing at 5:45am. Yes I was asleep goddamn it. I don't get to it quickly enough and the answering machine picks it up and hang up. Then I hear my mobile phone start ringing downstairs... must be some kind of family emergency so I make it downstairs in time to hear the home phone start up again. I answer, still half asleep and half scared that something big has happened.

> [Me] "Hello?"

> [FOF] "Hi DallasITGuy, this is $GuyYouBarelyKnow. Do you have a second? I can't get my laptop on my home wireless and I really need to check to make sure my flight is on time."

> [Me] "Who the fuck is this again?"

> [FOF] "This is $GuyYouBarelyKnow. I'm a friend of $OtherGuy. We met at $NeighborhoodBar a couple of weeks ago. My Internet's down and I remembered you're in IT so I looked up your number and gave you a ring. Can you help me real quick?

> [Me] YOU ~@!$~@#$$#$%*^%*&%$#^%@#$!@#$!@! !%!@$@! !#@$!$ !%$%#$^$#&$%*& @#$%@#$%@# @#$%@#$% @%@$#%#%@#%!! Do you know how early it is you presumptuous SOB? I barely even know you and you wake us up so I can help you with your ~#!#@$#@!~ Internet connection? Don't you ever ~!$!@!#%$! call me again you @!~!#@~^%!!

> [FOF] "Uhh... sorry... I didn't think you'd mind... I just...

> [Me] "Go F yourself!" Click.

So... I'm up now.

EDIT: I called $OtherGuy to find out if he gave the guy my home & mobile numbers. He did - last night about 8:00pm or so he claims. I made it clear to him that he's officially on my shit list as well. I'm tempted to do a conference call with both of them in the middle of the night every night for the next week, but I suppose that would keep me from sleeping as well and therefore be self defeating. Hell is other people.

----------------------------------------

backstory - I do end user implementation, training, and support for a web application that was developed by my firm. Our clients skew older.

>client: I can't get into my account. My login isn't working. This is ridiculous. I've been trying for hours and now I'm locked out.

>me: My apologies for the inconvenience! I've just reset your password. You should receive an email with a link to set and save a new password in a moment.

>c: I don't want to set a new password. I liked my old password. It's the same password I use for everything else and it's easy to remember.

>me: My sincere apologies, but you will need to set a new password in order to gain access to your account.

>c: Can't I just use my old password?

>me: No, our data security standards do not allow that. However, if for any reason you aren't able to follow the password reset link, I would be happy to generate a random password for you, and share it with you over the phone.

>c: Do that, then, and email the password to me.

>me: Again, my apologies, but part of our security policy states that we cannot email passwords in plain text. I would be happy to give you a call and share you password with you over the phone.

>c: Why are you being so difficult? I just want my old password to work again.

>me: Sir, I'm so sorry that this process has been frustrating for you. I want you to have access to your account. Have you followed the link in the password reset email?

>c: No. It looks like a virus. I don't want to click on it.

>me: I can assure you that it is not a virus. It is a hyperlink. You can just click on it, and it'll open a page in your browser where you can reset your password.

>c: That's ridiculous. That's so much work. Why do you make it so hard? This should be simple. I want to speak to your manager.

>me: (eager to pass them off on someone else) No problem. My manager is cc'd. He would be happy to assist you.

>manager: How can I help?

>c: Your employee is rude, stupid, and not helpful. I just want to log in, I don't want to reset my password, I don't want to click on this virus she sent me, and this is taking forever and it is ridiculous. 

>manager: Sir, respectfully, we are going to need you to meet us halfway and change your password.

>client: (in all caps, this is via email) THIS IS BULLSHIT. I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD. YOU ARE IDIOTS.

>manager: Again, we are sorry that this is frustrating for you. Please let us know what we can do to help. 

Manager cc's client's boss, the director of their org and the one whose signature is on the contract. My manager does not take shit from clients.

>client's boss (to their employee with us cc'd): Are you serious? These nice people are doing everything they can to help you, and you are abusing and belittling them. This is an embarrassment to our organization. You owe them both an apology, and you need to reset your password, stop complaining, and log in so you can get me that report that was supposed to be on my desk yesterday. The fact that you've wasted your entire day on this is ridiculous and this will definitely be included in your performance review.

My manager and I were in tears. Client's boss was savage af and did not pull a single punch. The client did end up resetting his password but did not apologize. Last time I sent out an email to clients, his bounced. His ass got fired. *evil cackle*

edit: woah, thanks for the gold!

https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5maaym/im_sorry_we_only_support_browsers_that_dont_exist/
----------------------------------------

Same company and website as previous tale here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ltdyz/why_consistent_password_policies_are_important/

So there's this website used by a few thousand paying customers - something like $200/year. It's used by pastors to download material to use in their church services. We support the following browsers -keep in mind this is probably ~~2002/2003~~ 2006 (thanks /u/gargarlord and /u/BCdotWHAT):

* Internet Explorer for Windows

* Internet Explorer for Mac

If you've never heard of Internet Explorer for Mac, be grateful. Anyway, Chrome did not yet exist, and Firefox either didn't, or was super early on and not that great. Then something happened. Microsoft killed IE for Mac. I don't mean they just stopped developing it. They pulled the download links, and more or less pretended it didn't exist. If you didn't already have it, there was no way to get it - if there was some sort of abandonware website or other repository for old software back then, I didn't know about it and couldn't find it.

Our Mac browser support remained the same: IE only.

>$Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with your website.

>$Me: What browser are you using?

>$Customer: Safari

>$Me, through gritted teeth: Unfortunately we don't support Safari. You'll need to use Internet Explorer.

>$Customer: Oh, how do I get that?

>$Me: You can't.

>$Customer: ...what?

>$Me: We only support Internet Explorer on Macs. If you have a Windows computer, you can use that. If not, you'll need to get Internet Explorer.

>$Customer: Ok...this is my only computer, so how do I get it?

>$Me: You can't. They no longer make it. It's not available anywhere.

>$Customer: So how do I use your website that I'm paying for?

>$Me: You can't.

>$Customer: Do you not see the problem here?

>$Me: Ok look, maybe we can help each other out here. We really should support Safari, but we don't. There's no other option. If possible, can you please write me an email, and be as upset as you can - swear, threaten to cancel, threaten to sue, whatever you can. I'll take it to the powers that be and try to get this fixed for you.

>$Customer: You want me to swear? I'm a pastor!

>$Me: I know. Look, it's Thursday afternoon. Getting this pushed through before Sunday isn't going to be easy.

>$Customer: I'm sure God will understand.

So I get this email from him, and it's everything I asked for - ranting and raving about how we're preventing him from doing God's work. Thankfully, he didn't complain about me at all. I take it to the web development team - same $Dev as in the previous story linked above.

>$Dev: So what's not working?

>$Me: [problem I can no longer remember]

>$Dev: I'm pretty sure it works. [Opens Safari and tests successfully.]

>$Me: Wait, we don't support Safari.

>$Dev, rolling eyes: I know. It works great, it's what I use all the time, faster than IE. But [$VP of something or other] won't approve the 30 minutes it'll take me to fix it for newer versions of Safari. I just don't upgrade mine so I can use it.

Thankfully, I had just helped $VP with a weird problem with his computer, and he was super grateful. I walked over to his office, and he happened to be free. It was about 3pm on a Thursday, and we closed at 4.
>$Me: Sorry to bug you, but...well, you should read this.
He reads the email, and his eyes go wide.

>$VP: This is from one of our customers?

>$Me: Yeah, he was trying to finish his sermon for Sunday and-

I didn't even finish my sentence before he was calling $Dev's manager. By 4:45, our website officially supported Safari and I was on the phone with $Customer to deliver the good news.

I'd like to think God understood.

*Click*  
   
$Usr was very quickly summoned to attend a meeting with HR and an appropriate Manager and I believe asked to accelerate themselves  and then elevate themselves while travelling at speed because IT Manager reviewed their activity a bit more thoroughly including their internet use when on the company network/VPN.  
  
$Usr then tried to sue for unfair dismissal. And IT Manger actually laughed out loud when he was told that the reason was 'Unfair invasion of privacy'.



The oddest ticket I've ever worked. - /u/Clickity_clickity
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6bxlmf/the_oddest_ticket_ive_ever_worked/
----------------------------------------

Sometimes, people pry apart my spreadsheets and tools and code for various reasons. And when they do, they find a hidden bit of code. I put it everywhere, as a sort of signature. People wonder what it is and they ask me. And I get to tell them this story.

~

I was a tier I remote support tech. This was one of my first officially IT jobs, and I was a young, fresh-faced, wide-eyed kid with a working knowledge of some kind of code and the ability to install Java with over a 50% success rate.

*ring ring* went the phone. I perked up. Another customer desperately in need, on the brink of disaster, had called upon me to single-handedly resolve their problem and leave them 110% satisfied. A problem I alone had the keys to fix (so long as it was within the exceptionally narrow purview of the types of problems I was trained to handle)!

"Thanks for calling Tech Support Megacorp! My name is Clickity, can I have your name and client number, please?"

There was a long pause and then the person slowly gave me their info. I plugged it into my system and BAM. I looked at the client's info: they were based out in Washington State. A very remote office, easily three or four hours' drive from their nearest deskside support analyst. If I couldn't fix their issue, they might not be up and running for days.

*I was their last hope.*

"So our computer's been running really slow," he guy starts out, and I jump on it.

"I see! Let me see if you have any hanging processes going on? Do you know what version of java you're running? Have you recently uninstalled or reinstalled any programs?"

No to all of these. our remote session was lagging for sure. But I couldn't find out what was the cause. 

"See it started after this storm..." the guy went onto a ramble about the weather and how they've been dealing with landslides and other unrelated things. meanwhile, I keps scrounging for data in the system. The processor was just running so slow.

"...and it's been hot and the computer smells pretty funny."

I slopped. "Smells funny? have you...um..have you cleaned it recently to get dust out of it?" I felt like a Genie-oos. Once he vacuumed that up he'd be all good to go.

There was a long pause while the guy presumably took the case off the PC. then-- "Agh! Oh god! aaaaaahgh!" *Slam. Slam.* "Over there!" Strings of profanity. Then quiet.

"Sir?" I asked after a moment. "Are you still there? is everything ok?"

"No!" he shouts. "there's a hole in the wall, and it looks like they got in after the storm...some...god, they've built a *hive*." 

"What?" 

He repeated himself. "So...yeah...can you like, get someone out here with a new PC or something? I know it's hard to get someone out here and all..."

Undeterred, I assured them I'd have someone out as soon as I could. I typed up the ticket and sent it on its way, and I never heard how it got resolved. But I will never forget that ticket as I sent it on its way:

>Computer completely filled with bees. Sending to deskside support.

~

I learned something important that day. Never take a problem at face value or assume you have all the pertinent info, no matter how usual it may seem. Listen when the customer gives you background info, some of it might be important. And never, ever, choose to work in deskside repair in the mountains.

And that is why, in every code or spreadsheet I've ever written, somewhere you will find the phrase "Computer completely filled with bees". To remind myself that no matter how much I feel like a Genie-oos, there's always room for being completely wrong and completely surprised.

**TL;DR**: Customer's PC had a bug I wasn't able to fix.



Buddy, you picked the wrong people to try and strong-arm. - /u/Saesama
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4v7jkk/buddy_you_picked_the_wrong_people_to_try_and/
----------------------------------------

Greetings, all. This one is from way back when, about six years ago now, when I was in an entirely different career and halfway around the world. No salad dressing this time, and I'm sure you're all disappointed.

On a certain class of military warship, there is a place. The bridge may be in control of where the ship goes, but Damage Control Central is in charge of how fast it is getting there and whether or not it arrives in one piece. It's run by a high-ranking officer from Reactor Department (EW) and his two cronies, one that monitors the ship's water usage and one that monitors the ship's electrical usage (hi) These three people can bring 97K+ tons of steel and sadness to a halt. Behind them are a small pile of engineering folk, literally the ship's tech support branch. People could call DCC and report a problem (from an out light to a fire), and between all of us in there, we had the knowledge, skill, authority, and political clout to get a response team out. A lot of people didn't know what kind of authority DCC held, or exactly who they were talking to when they called down. This made for some very entertaining conversations.

One evening, the engineering folk get a call. One female sailor picks it up and naturally, we all listen in, because if it's a fire or something, we all need to respond as rapidly as possible. From our POV, this is how the conversation goes:

>Eng: DCC, Eng speaking.  
>Eng: The heater doesn't work?  
>Eng: Oh, yeah, that's normal.  
>Eng: No, we can't turn it up.  
>Eng: What? No, we can't replace it, we're in the middle of the Persian Gulf, where are we going to get another one?  
>Eng: Look, it works fine. Take shorter showers.  
>Eng: Your division can put in a request for a bigger one when we get back to home port, but you're not getting one now.  
>Eng: Yeah, no, I'm not ordering one. Replacing those things is beyond the scope of what we're allowed to do underway.  
>Eng: Because policy.  
>Eng: Okay. You do that. We'll be waiting. Make sure you request permission to enter.  

With that, she hangs up. Naturally, we're all staring. She grins at us.

>Eng: Game faces on, this one is gonna be good. Sir, I am sorry in advance.  
>EW: You kidding? This shit is what makes watch worth-while.  

We sit back and put on our best 'I hate everything' faces and wait.

Not fifteen minutes later, the door thuds open. In walks (with permission) the hero of this little story, a very low-ranking punk (LRP) who think's he's hot shit because he does maintenance on air planes instead of steam pipes. With him is his immediate supervisor (LPO) a gentleman of my rank, and their divisional officer (Divo) a wee young lieutenant. Divo is all fired up because how dare Engineering not fix his guy's problem, and he makes a bee-line for the engineering folk.

This path will, briefly, place him between EW and a panel that, by the order of people with a rank I could never hope to achieve in my life, the EW is not allowed to be obscured from. They HAVE to be able to see it, at all times. I wait until the merry little band is almost in front of the EW before I speak up.

>Me: Sir, please go around, the EW needs to be able to see that panel.  
>Divo: I will walk where I damn well-  

He stops. Because someone of approximately double his rank, four times his time-in-service and significantly crankier is staring him down. All of the fire leaves Divo in an instant. Which, honestly, is exactly what I wanted. When high-ranking people get fired up, it's usually for a good reason. When baby divos get fired up, everyone in their general vicinity is stupider for witnessing their temper tantrum. Baby divos get much more done when they're calm.

LPO realizes that a Commander is sitting there and nearly poops himself. LRP is completely oblivious.

They walk back around our desks, not nearly as grudgingly as they could have, and take the slightly longer route to the engineering folk. Who are having the time of their lives, because this shit circus is well underway and they haven't had to even do anything yet. Eng spins around, her hands on the arms of her chair, a very pleasant, blank smile on her face.

>Divo: Are you the one that won't fix my guy's showers?  
>Eng: The showers aren't broken, sir. Did he tell you what his complaint was?  

LPO nearly cringes out of his skin. Because, no, obviously what happened is that LRP went and bitched at LPO that 'those assholes in engineering said they won't fix the broken showers' and LPO immediately went to his office to find some back-up and grabbed Divo. By the way we're all grinning at him, LPO knows he is in for the ass-reaming of his life.

Divo, however, looks to LRP for an explanation. The little nematode puffs up, very pleased to have the floor, and an audience to boot. At least two Very Important Officers get to hear his sound reasoning for calling down to the tech line. I sit there wishing popcorn was allowed in DCC.

>LRP: Well, the hot water heater in the head can't keep up with the entire division when we all shower in the morning.  
>Eng: Does it put out hot water at all?  
>LRP: Well, yeah, when we all get up it works just fine. But as everyone takes their showers, it gets colder and colder.  
>Eng: Does it ever go completely cold?  
>LRP: No, but with a bigger heater, we could all take as long of showers as we wanted without it running out.  
>Water Control Guy: Showers should be limited to five minutes, you're wasting water.  
>LRP: Well, yeah, morning showers are pretty short, who wants to wake up early and shower? But when I take my second, longer shower in the evening, to relax after a long day of working-  

Some teeny tiny sense of self-preservation kicks in and LRP shuts up and looks around. He is in a room full of people who play the 'food, shower, sleep - pick 2' game on a daily basis. Every single person in this room, including his back-up, is staring at him with either full derision or outright hostility.

Except Eng. She's still smiling her blank, polite, 'I have been in the retail trenches and am dead inside' smile. I may be in love.

>Eng: Sir, you can see why I denied his request. LPO, you may want to remind your guys that, despite being surrounded with water, there is a limit on how much fresh water we can make in a day and that long showers should be saved for in port. Was there anything else I can help you all with?  
>Divo: No, I think I've heard enough. You two, my office. *Now.*  

They leave. LPO looks close to tears or shoving LRP out a porthole. Divo is full of now-justified wrath. LRP still looks vaguely bemused as to why his excellent argument didn't sway us all to his side.

The door shuts. All of us immediately put our heads on our desk and cry with laughter. Someone hands Eng an IOU for drinks at the next port. 

Eng's supervisor drafts an email to the ship's mid-tier leadership that not waking up early enough to get a hot shower is not a reason to request a new hot water heater and that water on board is limited. No details are provided and everyone eagerly looks forward to the rumor mill as people try and figure out what spawned *that* particular reminder.

The engines turn. The ship chugs on.

> Me: Hello this is the IT department.

I fixed it, I want the free food promised to me, mom. - /u/Bytewave

----------------------------------------

My mom is sweet, but she has this notion she shouldn't bother me unless its important. 

My phone rang last week while I was home. Day off.

> Mom: "Do you have a minute honey? My internet doesn't work, either computer, nor the tablet either.. I was thinking maybe you could come have dinner later and look at it? I bought chicken, soft cheese, wine, and I'm baking a.."

Somewhere later down the menu I already fixed it. I work at the telco, and have access to my tools remotely, I saw it had no valid IP so I reset the modem and the router we provide her. Basic lease renewal issue. It happens, everything else is green.

> Bytewave: "Boom, magic, you're online mom."

> Mom: " Whaa? ... Oh. You're right." *Sounds disappointed.* "Thank you, that was really fast, I guess I won't trouble you to come over then."

... Clearly she was more excited at the prospect of the meal than the free tech support, but  for her it seems something broken or a holiday is required to 'trouble' me to hang out.

> Bytewave: " Hey hey there, I was promised a home cooked meal here. I'm happy to come anyway."

> Mom: "Haa that's fine, its nice of you to be polite. But I know you're busy, you don't have to. We can do this another time."

Okay let's do this the easy way. Reach back to the tools, deprovision the router.

> Bytewave: "There, its broken again mom. And it'll stay that way till dessert."

> Mom: "Oh! Lovely then, shall we say 6 o'clock?" *cheerful*

In which a doctor understands how IT works - /u/dongholio
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/57gfiy/in_which_a_doctor_understands_how_it_works/
----------------------------------------

Standard disclaimer, not IT, I just know how to google things.

I have a very good friend who is a doctor.  I sometimes ask him for tips on health related things, and he often comes to me for technical / mechanical advice.  It wasn't always this way, though.  Near the beginning of our friendship, an incident happened involving an iPhone 3GS (back when it first came out) that really helped pave the way for understanding between the two of us.

(Over the phone)  
>Doc:  "Hey I'm having some problems with my iPhone, can you help?"  
>Me:  "Sure, are you on it right now?"  
>Doc:  "No, I'm calling from my landline."  
>Me:  "OK, great, what's the problem?"  
>Doc:  "It's not working."  
>Me:  "....yes, go on."  
>Doc:  "I just said.  It's not working."  
>Me:  "Is it not turning on?  Is it not being responsive?"  
>Doc:  "It's on, just not working.  I thought you knew iPhones?"  

At this point, I was starting to lose my patience.

>Me:  "OK, imagine I called you up.  You can't see me, but you want to help me.  And all I'm willing to say is that it hurts.  But I refuse to tell you what hurts, where it hurts, how it hurts, and what I was doing before it started hurting.  All I'm telling you over the phone is that it hurts, and I'm getting impatient with YOU.  How would you feel?"  
>Doc:  (Defensive)  "I'd assume you didn't understand biology and and would ask a few diagnostic questions to narrow it down."  
>Me:  "I just told you.  It hurts.  I thought you knew about medicine?"  
>Doc:  "How can I help you if you won't tell me what actually hurts?"  
>Me:  "EXACTLY MY POINT!"  

That was a "come to Jesus" moment for my friend, and he started being a bit more descriptive.  I also would later hear from him that he ended up being an "IT Liaison" at his hospital since he was able to more accurately describe problems to the IT help desk than his colleagues.

Edit:  First, thanks to /u/jakimfett for the Gold!

Second, a few of you mentioned this story sounds familiar.  There are a few reasons that might be:

- I've told this story in shortened form in the comments here and on other forums (likely on fark.com) in years past.

- Other people have also used very similar analogies.

- A combination of the above, AND I've stripped out a lot of the idiosyncratic parts of the conversation that only two friends would have but bears little relevance to the conversation (talking about cars, talking about hot miserably hot the weather was, talking about how jealous I was that he managed to get a 3GS so quickly, etc.).



I'm not your IT. - /u/Ten_DU
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4wvbxd/im_not_your_it/
----------------------------------------

Ok so this little gem started yesterday, currently working in managed print industry - customer logs a call saying no devices in a building are working, so definitely server/software related.

I log in with their IT, the server is freezing and when logging in with a new account there is a disk space error. So i inform him he needs to clear it down or add some HDD space and we can then troubleshoot anything if there are issues once its done.

Call the end user who logged the call, and let her know but... it makes no sense to her, depressing conversation occurs:

>Me: Morning, just calling regarding your printing issues at site X, its due to a server fault your IT are looking into - they should hopefully have it resolved soon which will likely resolve your issues.

>User: Oh, well the printer still isnt working, none of them are, this is URGENT.

>Me: I understand, but your IT is looking into it due to a server fault and should have it sorted as soon as possible.

>User: Ok, so when are you coming out to fix it?

>Me: I would not be able to fix the machine on site, it is a server issue as its run out of disk space, and your IT are looking into it.

>User: This is urgent the ENTIRE site cant print, whats the ETA on the fix?

>Me: I am not your IT so i am unable to advise, you would have to call them as they need to resolve it.

>User: I need an ETA to inform the users and management.

>Me: Im not in your IT so i cant give an ETA unfortuantely.

>User: Talk to my manager.

>Manager: we need an ETA for the fix or send someone on site, i want this actioned ASAP.

>Me: I'm not your IT, i'm from the managed print support company, the issue is with your server and your IT are looking to fix it. An engineer from us wont be able to assist.

>Manager: So you are categorically stating YOUR print engineer cant fix the printer? What kind of support is this?!

>Me: The issue isn't with the printer, its with the server the print software is on, which your IT are looking to fix urgently.

>Manager: No, the PRINTER is not PRINTING so its a PRINTER problem, we don't have servers.

>Me: You do have servers, it's what governs the pull print and login for the devices, and it's currently down, your IT are looking to fix it.

>Manager: why are you refusing to fix this? You can't just say no we have a support contract!

>Me: Your IT fix your servers, we fix the printers and the software thats on the server. You need to call your IT.

>Manager: Im escalating this to my director - expect a call back shortly

*Click*

What - the - actual - fuck.

Had several calls since then i have ignored - informed their account manager whats going on - this is now his mountain of stupid to deal with.

Tl:DR printers don't work - server has no space on C drive, IT fixing - IM NOT THE USERS FUCKING IT TEAM.

Edit: Thanks for the Gold! Glad it made someones day! 




Hell of a way to start the day. Screw people like this. - /u/DallasITGuy
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4u88v2/hell_of_a_way_to_start_the_day_screw_people_like/
----------------------------------------

Last night I did a scheduled upgrade of Quickbooks for a client. 1 server, 10 desktops, 3 databases. Went well.

As usual with an upgrade like this I'm scheduled to be on site the next day for a couple of hours to help out / answer questions about the new version. In this case scheduled for Monday morning since like most offices they're closed over the weekends.

Cell phone rings this morning at 7:30am. I don't recognize the number so I ignore it. They then proceed to call back continuously for the next 10 minutes, never leaving a message until the last call. I listen to the message - it's from a staff person at the client where I upgraded Quickbooks, irate as hell yelling "QUICKBOOKS IS BROKEN! I CAN'T DO MY JOB! THIS IS GOING TO COST THE COMPANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS! YOU BETTER DAMN WELL GET THIS FIXED. GET OVER HERE! CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY!" etc.

So I remote in to the remote desktop server, verify that all is well, take a deep breath and call her back. She proceeds to berate me until she runs out of breath, never tells me what the problem is but instead focuses on how her inability to enter some transactions she didn't get to Friday is going to cause the end of life on this planet. After several minutes I finally get her to tell me what problem she's having when she runs the program.

"IT WON'T START!"

"Does it give you an error message when you try to start it? What do you see?"

"I CAN'T RUN IT! THERE'S NO ICON ON THE DESKTOP! YOU NEED TO GET OUT HERE AND FIX THIS NOW! YOU'RE KILLING THE COMPANY!"

I remote into her system. The icon is there - in the exact same place as it was before - but it's a different icon. Still titled "Quickbooks" of course, but it's a different color. I tell her to watch the screen, double click it and of course QB comes right up.

I remind her that this is a new version and that some commands / screens will look a bit different. She accuses me of screwing around with it just to make things more difficult for her. I tell her that's not the case, ask her if there's anything else I can do to assist. A couple more ugly comments from her and we end the call.

My phone system sends me voicemails as emails with MP3 attachments. I forwarded the email to the owner of the company and told him I expect to be treated more professionally in the future. Frankly I hope it costs her her job.

Screw this and to hell with people like this.



**Monday update:** Went into the client's office this morning to assist with any issues they might have with the new version of QB (none to speak of). Complainer stayed out of my way, literally left her desk while I was in the vicinity. As I was getting ready to leave the owner of the firm called me into his office this morning and apologized for her voicemail tirade, said he'd have a talk with her. I was cordial, told him no need to, etc. and didn't bring up her behavior when I was trying to help her. As I left he had her in his office and was playing back the voicemail. 

About a half hour later she called and apologized. Sounded very beaten down, it was clear he'd given her a major tongue lashing. Her apology was about as enthusiastic as that of a 6 year old caught stealing cookies but I took the high road, thanked her and told her I'd be happy to help her in the future. Didn't say any of the many things I would have liked to because reaming her out is not worth pissing off the guy who writes the checks.

Pretty much what I expected to happen. The owner's a solid guy. Has been a client for over 12 years. 





The CEO of 3500 employees just called... - /u/SorryforbeingDutch
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2boj2i/the_ceo_of_3500_employees_just_called/
----------------------------------------

This happened a while back but it's still the best thing that ever happened to me at work. True story.

So, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. You can imagine this was a very big company. We were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car.


I usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. It was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights.

The phone rings.

> Yes hello, this the secretary of the CEO. We need you to come over NOW! We have a big problem.

> ME: What seems to be wrong?

> Her: Mr CEO is trying to open a file in Word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. I THINK WE ARE BEING HACKED! 

(this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower)

> Me: I'll take a look from here and take over your screen. Hang on.

So i take over his screen this is what happens:
File, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL*UUU**JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

> HER: I don't know what this is. You see?!? THis is so weird...

Now, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. You don't just walk into the exec office every day.

> ME: Uhuh. I'll be there as soon as possible!


So i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. A very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. 

They even had their own dining room and bar. THe security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and 

understood the importance.
I get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked.
> Come over, have a look at this! The ceo says..


He shows me:
File, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL*UUU**JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS


So i look at him. I look at every single person in that room. You could feel the suspense. I look back at the computer. I pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask:

> try again please?

The looks on their face: Priceless.
(Got a free lunch with the CEO)

After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2kgh4e/the_mothership_is_following_me_via_gps/) tale by /u/jayykidd, it brought back memories of a client of my own that was Paranoid and Rightly So (as an aside, /u/jayykidd, we are totally making PARS a thing around here). 

As a bit of backstory, I spent five years doing IT consulting in a rural town about an hour from Portland, OR. I worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs. My job was primarily server/network engineering-centric, but having done my time as a front-line tech I'd periodically involve myself in the more interesting/complex cases we'd see from our walk-in customers. 

One day we had a woman come in. She caught my eye because she was in her late thirties or early forties, and actually quite attractive. She had short, platinum blonde hair and bright red lips, and was dressed and styled like she was transplanted right out of a 1950's era magazine ad. One of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her. Right out the gate I can tell she is panicked and, by the sound of it, tin-foil hat levels of crazy. Shit, there goes any desire I had to flirt with her and maybe see if I could buy her a drink. I listen in on the conversation anyways, because it's at least a change of pace from the monotony of my day-to-day.

After a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is spying on her through all manner of devices, my bench tech looks back at me with a *can-you-please-come-help-me-and-make-her-go-away* look on his face. I oblige, as I appreciated that the front-line guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things. I walked up front, introduced myself as the supervisor, and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious it'd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it. Now that I was seeing her up close, I could tell that under her classy outfit and Marilyn Monroe-esque makeup was a deeply distraught woman. Her eyes looked baggy, and tired. Like she had been up too late crying.  

Obviously, at this point I'm just playing along. This isn't my first rodeo, and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer, we tell them our hourly rate for forensics ($150 an hour), and suddenly the men-in-black-suits watching them aren't that big of a deal anymore. Now, to be fair, we actually *did* specialize in computer forensics and data recovery, working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help, we even had a guy on staff full-time who wore that hat most days. The local police were pretty small-time and farmed out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract. In the cases where people *did* want to pay, we would do our due diligence, and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly.  We would meet with attorneys and testify in court, as necessary. Generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce proceeding where one spouse accused the other of cheating or something similar, and wanted evidence to back that up.  

Back to the client at hand. She insists her husband is monitoring her every move, tracking her vehicle, monitoring her computer, and recording her in her own home. Here's where it gets interesting: She claims that she *knows* all of this, because he has told her about it. In fact, he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to tamper with any of it. She says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him, but ostensibly without some sort of evidence of his behavior, nobody would take her seriously. 

I give her the crazy litmus test and I tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate. $300 an hour, four hour minimum. 

She pulls out her wallet. 

Fuck, she's serious. 

We agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the GPS tracker. She says she is parked several blocks away so her husband won't know she came to a computer store (we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores). So I grab my toolbag and holler at one of my colleagues (who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk) to join me. 

So the lady, myself, my colleague, and BOTH of our now intensely curious bench techs (all of us in matching company polos) follow this lady down the street to her car. What a motley crew we must have been. We get to her minivan begin our process of looking for this GPS device. Now, GPS trackers (at least the commercially available ones) require two things, generally: dedicated 12v power and an unobstructed (at least by metal) view of the sky. They basically use GPS to grab the coordinates and then a GSM/CDMA (cellular) signal to relay the positional data to a web interface or something. So there really aren't that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet. We spend some time looking around the undercarriage, rocker panels, and even bits of the interior. Battery doesn't have any additional leads running off of it, fuse box isn't tapped anywhere for power. Nothing. Just as I'm starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as I had perhaps hoped, I find the fucking thing.

It was tiny, not much bigger than a flash drive, and mounted behind the front grille. It looked pretty much exactly like [this](http://www.amazon.com/LandAirSea-LAS-1505-Tracking-Vehicle-System/dp/B000H9E9UG). 

The reason it didn't need auxiliary power is that it wasn't an active device. This device did not provide real-time tracking, rather it used some internal memory and a couple AAA batteries to log GPS data for days at a time. At some point, when the van was not in use, the guy would grab the GPS device, upload the data to his laptop, maybe swap batteries, then remount it to the car. 

Fucking hell, this lady was very much indeed Paranoid And Rightfully So. 

Now that we've established that she isn't batshit insane but that she actually *is* being tracked by her husband, the tone amongst our team became drastically more serious. Obviously, something sinister is going on, and we aren't sure what, but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life. She has entrusted *us* to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him, which is something I think all of us took quite seriously.

We show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because it's the first evidence she has physically seen. We take photos of it, and carefully install it back where it belongs. I sort of assumed that a GPS tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order, but she seemed insistent that she would need more evidence to make it stick.

Our next moves have to be conducted very deliberately. She claims that her home is bugged, and so is her computer. We will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly, but it will have to be at a time when both her husband isn't home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her, leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the day's end. We couldn't chance him coming home later, reviewing whatever it was he was recording, and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated. 

It wasn't going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right. We made arrangements with her back at the office and I offered to walk her back to her car. She accepted, and on the way she confided in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband. In the interest of protecting her privacy I'll simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how manipulative he was, and when she said she wanted out he wasn't about to let that happen. I asked her again if she really was afraid for her life, and the sincerity of her "yes" was both scary and heartbreaking for me. I asked her if she had thought about getting a gun, and she said she had, but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account. 

As the gravity of the situation weighed on me, I offered to let her borrow one of mine. She was awestruck, but I assured her that it was completely okay. At the time, I had several handguns and rifles, and I couldn't think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one. My car was parked close by, and we walked over to it. I tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with guns, as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger, especially one that might not know what to do with it, was unsettling to me. It sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function, had gone shooting before, etc. In my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself outweighed the cons, so I moved forward. In the trunk, I had a [Ruger LCP](http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html), which is a very small .380 caliber handgun that I kept in my Get Home Bag/emergency survival kit. It was fitted with the factory installed Crimson Trace laser grips, which I had dialed in to about 10 meters. We went over the basics of how to use it safely, I showed her how the laser worked, and told her that, for her situation, all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was. She was crying, and frankly at this point I pretty much was, too. I gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to. We hugged for a while before parting ways. It wasn't a romantic hug or anything, it was that kind of hug that's exchanged when someone *needs to be held*. Like, when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something. She needed the comfort of knowing that she wasn't alone, that at least one person took her seriously, and I'd like to think that I gave her some hope that things would be *okay*. 

The next week was tense, as we prepared for our investigation. My coworkers and I spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to triage her computer to look for evidence, as well as how to approach the search of the house. When the day finally came, we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools, flashlights, laptops...anything we might need. 

I set to work immediately on her computers (a home desktop and a personal laptop) while two of my colleagues began their search of the house. I removed the drives from her PCs, and using a USB write-blocker, (which physically prevented me from writing/modifying any information on her drives) I made a clone of both drives. For the sake of speed, both drives were cloned to SSDs. Once cloned, I put the PCs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating. The drives were mounted into a quarantine VM, with no WLAN access. Scanning the drives with a number of antimalware programs didn't turn anything up. Looking through the file system however (paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files), turned up some things that didn't look quite right (filenames and directories that looked obfuscated). I made the call to boot up both PCs off of the cloned SSDs and look that them live to see if maybe I could catch an obfuscated process running, or something. 

Nothing.

With nothing else open, I ran a *netstat -an* out of CMD. There were a handful of TCP connections active. One by one, I started performing DNS lookups on the IPs. Everything was normal active connections for background processes like Skype. Then, I found it. An active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name. It looked like a license key with a *.com* at the end of it. Something like 24W25-188EGFF-98001QRD.com. 

It was hiding in plain sight, and it was registered to SpectorSoft Corporation. Guess what they sell? Yup. Surveillance software.

The PC was running something called [Spector Pro](http://www.spectorsoft.com/products/SpectorPro_Windows/), which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities, browsing history, keylogging, even sending remote screen captures to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords. It was the full nine yards for monitoring. 

I screen capped everything for my logs, shut the system down, and swapped the forensic SSDs for the original disks to put everything back the way it was. 

Not too long after, our other two guys found some evidence of their own. Two separate (and frankly, rather rudimentary) CMOS cameras hidden in the master bedroom. One in the closet in a shoebox, one in the smoke detector in the ceiling. Both, if I recall correctly, were simply wired to 9V batteries and recorded to SD cards. All things considered, they were pretty low tech. The contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day, and the battery probably changed at least as often. 

We didn't touch anything. Lots of photographs were taken. We went back to the office and compiled all of the evidence into a document for her, and I passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation. I met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court. 

The gratitude she had for us was absolutely immeasurable. We didn't charge her for our services. Getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from engaging in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough.

I'd like to tell you that I know how this story ends. I'd like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever, and my supreme IT prowess and white-knightery wooed her into my arms and we lived happily ever after. But frankly, I don't really know what happened. What I *can* tell you that about a week after we gave her our report, I met her for coffee at a place across the street. She looked visibly better. Her puffy, tired eyes were gone, replaced instead by ones that seemed to glisten with warmth. Her skin was radiant and beautiful. She was smiling, for the first time I'd seen. An immense weight had been lifted off of her, and it showed. She told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad, that a restraining order was in place on her estranged husband, and that she was finally filing for divorce. She told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe, and that she felt happy. 

In the parking lot, she gave me back the little handgun, profusely thanking me again for the work we did. She hugged me, both of us teary-eyed, and we parted ways. For me, it proved to be one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences of my career. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who's gilded this post! It's definitely put a smile on my face.

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bb3ki/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_1/) Part 2 [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bhoz1/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_3/) [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2blg90/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_4/)

The email was pretty self-explanatory. "Due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern, I have had to temporarily block access to spotify. I apologize for the inconvenience."

It got around relatively quickly that Jack was the one responsible. Two of the interns quit. They stopped playing music out loud. None of them talked to Jack.

He wasn't in the intern room for very long anyway. About a week after his hire, Boss's Wife decided to let Jack just use her office while she wasn't there, presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him.

*

Day 8. I got an email from Jack. "I'm having issues accessing Buzzfeed."

I didn't even move from my chair, emailing back a simple reply: "Due to management concerns, Buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings."

His email was immediate. "Please? I just want to check some things while I'm on lunch."

I replied back a simple "No" and went about my day. and that was the last I ever heard from Jack.

I'm kidding. *Of course it wasn't.*

*

Day 9. Someone had opened my desk. See, I have a laptop in my desk. The laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it, like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usually-blocked news site. It's common knowledge I have it.

Someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop.

I stormed down to the officer manager's desk. She and I have the only two keys to my desk. I told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing.

"Oh?" she said, confused. "Boss came down here and needed the key to your desk."

"Boss!?" I was taken aback. "I...alright." Maybe Boss needed the laptop for something, I told myself. But that didn't stop me from going straight to Boss' Wife's office.

There, sitting at the polished hardwood desk, sat Jack, with my laptop. And my desk key next to it.

I approached. "Jack, I need you to give me that back."

Jack shook his head. "I got approval from Boss. The computer in here was acting funny, so I asked if I could use your spare laptop and he said yes."

I was completely stunned. "So you asked Boss to get you the key to my desk--" I picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket--"then take my laptop, and use it for..." I looked over the screen. Two windows docked side by side: Facebook and Cheezburger. "...this?"

He shifted the laptop so I couldn't see the screen and cleared his throat like I was intruding on his private data. "Thanks. You can go now."

*You can go now.*

*You. Can. Go. Now.*

Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Shit doesn't work like this, man. I felt like I wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me, but I steadied my hand and took a breath. The only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern.

The only laptop with unrestricted access.

I smiled at Jack. "Alright, no problem. Have a good day." I walked out of the office.

I had a plan. Jack was fucking going **down**.

**Edit**: WOW! Thanks to whoever gave me gold!

"Dude...your self-control must be like Gandhi." My friend Steve, who works for one of my company's clients, heard me ranting about Jack while we had a coffee.

I shook my head. "I know. But what am I gonna do? Slap him? Get myself fired?"

"Sounds like it'd be worth it."

I sighed and took a steadying sip of my coffee. "I have a plan, though. But I need your help."

He perked up and then scowled. "My help? Oh, no. I don't like this guy much, but--"

"I'll put the whole story on reddit if you help me."

He thought about it. "Alright, but on one condition: You tell everyone that I am the hero that made your evil plan possible."

And so, for the record, Steve became the hero who made my evil plan possible.

*

Day 11. I got a call from Boss. "Clickity, I just got a call from Jack."

*Of course you did.* "What seems to be the problem, Boss?"

"He says you've made his new computer not work."

I blinked, staring at the speaker phone. "*His* new computer? You mean our unrestricted computer that he's...using?"

"Yes, yes, that one." I could almost see Boss lean in to the speakerphone. "I don't know what your problem is, Clickity, but Jack complains that you're preventing him from working. So i need you to fix his computer now." Click.

As if on cue (or more, as if he had been outside the office listening) Jack appeared at my doorway with the laptop. "So I need you to undo whatever you did." He opened the laptop and sat it in front of me, on top of my paperwork as if to say *You know...Regardless of whatever you were doing ten seconds ago.*

I seethed, pulling out a usb drive and plugging it into the laptop. I grumbled wordlessley as I clicked a few buttons on the laptop and then a few on my computer. I unplugged the USB drive and closed the laptop. "There. Have a nice day."

Jack picked up the laptop and turned for the door. "You better not screw with me again."

As soon as he was gone I smashed my pencil sharpener with my fist.

*

Day 14. It was the perfect day. Boss's wife was in the office so Jack was sharing her desk and, from the looks of my remote viewer, doing absolutely nothing at all.

I sent out an email.

> To: Internemail@company

> From: clickity@company

> Subject: Intern Appreciation day

> Hiya interns! I just cleared this with the office manager. For your hard work, I'm treating you guys to lunch. Go see the office manager and pick up a (Local Pub and Burger Joint) gift card and have a great day. Thanks for your hard work!

A few minutes later the phone rang. Boss's wife's office.

"IT, this is Clickity."

"This is Jack. I just saw all the interns walk out...what's going on?"

"Oh, it's intern appreciation day. Didn't you get the email? I sent it to the...oh." I sighed. "I completely forgot to send it to your email because it's separate. Yeah, all the interns are getting lunch."

"Thanks for letting me know," Jack said with audible edge to his voice. "If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have told me at all, would you--" He's cut off by a disapproving "tsk" from Boss's wife.

I cleared my throat and ignored Jack's I-Own-You attitude. "Go quick and you can still catch them--"

"Fine." Jack hung up the phone.

I took a few reassuring breaths and texted Steve.



Got to give a firearms lesson yesterday - /u/roudyrod
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/67npnl/got_to_give_a_firearms_lesson_yesterday/
----------------------------------------

So I go out to a call where the desktop is not powering on.  Go out there and the first thing I find is a Springfield XD 9mm sitting on top of the machine.  This client is kinda known for keeping random guns in random places and I know the lady who's computer this is knows jack shit about guns.

I point to it and say "what do you want me to do with this?" and she says "is the safety on?"  I'm a gun guy but I've never handled an XD so I confuse the mag release with the safety and drop the magazine.  At this point I'm fairly sure it has a round in the tube so I tell her I'm going to work the slide to eject the bullet.

Sure enough, I eject one out on her desk and now she is asking me where the safety is.  I'm not seeing one other than the Glock type trigger so I tell her there isn't one and that keeping it hot like that is probably a bad idea.  I have to explain that you can put a mag in the gun without putting one in the chamber and all you have to do is jack the slide and it will be ready to shoot.

I'm an IT guy out on a computer call and I had to break down how a semi-automatic pistol works to a customer....fucking tuesdays.



Vladimir. ... Vladimir. ... *VLADIMIR!!* - /u/Merkuri22
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/54u55e/vladimir_vladimir_vladimir/
----------------------------------------

When I started working for my current company there was a customer who was already infamous.  He was one of those people who was known only by his first name.  Everyone knew exactly who you were talking about when you said you'd had to take a call from Vladimir.  

They tried to protect me, as the newbie, from Vladimir as long as possible, but one day when I'd been at the company for maybe six months it just couldn't be avoided.  No one else was available but me, and he was in a royal fury.  The operator called me up, apologized to me (even she knew who he was) and told me that she had no one else to take him.  I reluctantly agreed to take the call.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, this is the exchange the operator had with him immediately before she passed him to me.

> **Operator:** I'm going to pass you to Merkuri22.  She's new.

> **Vladimir:** *(shouts)* I don't want somebody new!  I want somebody who knows something!

> **Operator:** *(shouts back)* She knows a lot, Vladimir!! *(slams down receiver, passing him to me)*

Vladimir's no Bob.  He's a fairly intelligent guy, but he gets frustrated super quick, and has a very hot temper.  I swear, sometimes when he calls us he doesn't want his issue to be fixed, he just wants to let us know the torture our product is putting him through.  He calls us to be a martyr on the line, and shout at us about how terrible the product is.  And my first call with him was one of those.

Luckily, Operator was right.  I knew a lot.  I had picked up on our products super quick, and the issue he called me about was a piece of cake.  The hard part was getting him to shut up long enough to tell him the solution to his issue.  I managed to calm him down and fix his problem, and not long after that I had become his favorite tech.  It had very quickly gone from, "I don't want to talk to her!!!" to, "Get me Merkuri22!  I need to speak to Merkuri22!  Nobody else can solve my problems, *nobody!!*"

***

I learned to read his moods like a medium reading tea leaves.  Sometimes it was best to meet his fire with a the cool exterior of a nurse at a mental hospital explaining why we don't hit other patients, and other times I could only get his attention by spitting flames back in his face.

Other techs could always tell when I was talking to Vladimir because they'd hear a one-sided conversation that went something like this:

> **Me:** Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* *VLADIMIR!!* *Pause.* You know I'm trying to help you, right?  Do you want me to get this working for you, or not?  *Pause.* Okay, then let me explain what's happening here...

***

Many times in my career I've compared what I do to the TV show House.  Tech support is a lot like diagnosing a patient.  I frequently tell my techs, "Customers lie," (playing on House's "Patients lie") and every time I say it I'm thinking of Vladimir.  This is why I swear sometimes he'd call up just to try to prove to me that our product is crap, because he'd frequently lie to me about what did and didn't work.  He'd tell me whatever would mean he needed to be in a panicked state, up against a deadline that he could not possibly meet, all because our products suck.

One time he called me up with an issue where I knew exactly what it was.  I'd just solved it for another customer the day before.  We were on a remote meeting and I could see his screen.

> **Vladimir:** I tried *everything* and *nothing* works!

> **Me:** Oh, I know what this is.  You need to do <solution>.

> **Vladimir:** I *told* you!  I *tried* that and *it didn't work!*

> **Me:** *(thinks) That's impossible, it has to work when you do that.*

> **Me:** What exactly did you do?

> **Vladimir:** I did <exactly what I told him> and *it didn't work!  Nothing works!  I told you!*

> **Me:** Can you do it again so I can see the steps you took?

> **Vladimir:** *I TOLD YOU I DID <solution> AND IT DIDN'T WORK!*

> **Me:** Vladimir, calm down.  Can you do it one more time?  Do it for me?

> **Vladimir:** *(calmer)* Fine.  I'll do it again for you.  See, I do this, and I click here, and I don't see-- oh, it's working this time!  You're the best!  I always know when I call you up that you'll fix it for me!

***

A few years later, Vladimir's favorite support grunt (me) was promoted to manager.  I was a working manager for a while, trying to manage my team and take calls at the same time, but that proved to not be very efficient, and after years of that I reduced the calls I directly took down to almost nothing.  Vladimir was *not* pleased.

One day he was having a hissy fit, and was demanding to speak to no one but me, even though he'd been told many times that I was now a manager and didn't take direct calls.  This particular day I was in and out of meetings about another customer who was legitimately having serious issues, and I couldn't make time for Vladimir.  There were times when the operator literally couldn't find me because I was bouncing between conference rooms and upper management offices.  

At one point the operator (now a different woman from earlier in this post) came and found me physically.  She was crying.  She told me about how upset Vladimir was, and how he was demanding to speak to me and wouldn't let her pass him to anyone else on the team, and she didn't know what to do.

I was *livid*.  I still didn't have time to call him back because that other customer's issue was far from over and there were political ramifications I had to juggle, but I took a few minutes to write Vladimir a scathing email.  I told him that it was not the operator's fault that I wasn't available, shouting at her wouldn't make me come to the phone any faster, and that he was sabotaging his own attempts to get a solution by refusing to speak with the available qualified techs who were happy to help him with his issue.  I made sure he knew the operator's name, and that he'd made her cry.  Then I went back to trying to keep my other customer from hemorrhaging blood.

Not long after I sent that email, the operator found me again, and told me that this had happened...

> **Operator:** Thank you for calling <company>, how may I direct your call?

> **Vladimir:** Is this <operator's name>?

> **Operator:** *(recognizes his voice, tenses up)* Yes, it is.

> **Vladimir:** This is Vladimir.  I just wanted to apologize.  I did not mean to yell at you.  That was completely unacceptable of me.

> **Operator:** Wow... t-thank you!  That means a lot to me.  *Pause.* Do you want to talk to tech support?

> **Vladimir:** No, thanks, I just called to apologize.  Have a nice day.  *Click.*

That was one of my proudest moments as a manager, making Vladimir call back just to apologize.

***

He still calls us up every once in a while.  I haven't talked to him in years.  He's found another favorite, but every once and a while he still tells her about the way Merkuri22 used to do things, and tells her to go ask me for answers.  He still lies to her.  Sometimes she comes to me and says:

> **Tech:** Vladimir says the last time this happened you told him to do <x>.

> **Me:** I absolutely did not.

> **Tech:** I figured.

And sometimes I still hear from someone else's cube...

> Vladimir... Vladimir... VLADIMIR!  Listen to me!...

Part 1 [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2be9fw/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_2/) [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bhoz1/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_3/) [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2blg90/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_4/)

I had been working as a small office's sysadmin for a little over two months when Jack was hired. Jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my boss's wife. Jack grew up in the wealthiest county in the state (where my Boss lives) and has had everything he ever wanted. A sense of entitlement that hung around him like the smell of five-day-old socks was the first thing I noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office.

"Jack, this is Clickity, our, erm...uh...tech...guy..." My boss introduces me, in that way that old bosses who don't use computers often do.

Jack extends his hand. "Oh, cool. Nice to meet ya."

I shake. "Welcome aboard."

Jack is very eager to get started doing...whatever. "Will I get a business email?" as if this is the most interesting thing ever. Adorable, I think.

"Eventually, yes. For the moment though, we have a shared email for interns on staff. I'll get you the credentials shortly." Most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own. just standard procedure.

"You run the firewall, right?"

"Yes."

"So you can block and unblock sites?"

"Yes." Jack's eager smile is contagious.

"Cool! Nice to meet you." He waves and the Boss and Jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere.

Now, dear reader, you might be wondering why I would call Jack the worst end user ever given his politeness and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is, and what a sysadmin does. That's above average when it comes to end users.

Well, we're only getting started here with Jack.

--

The first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot. He apparently explained to the Boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern. See, Jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to Mother, she would complain to Boss-Wife, who would complain to Boss. And Boss, figuring an email is a small thing to ask for, had a request to set up a personalized email account for Jack on my desk within the hour.

This was not to be a good start of a relationship with one's IT Guy.

--

Day 2, I got an IT ticket for the room where the interns work. it's a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long. Because it's such mind-numbing work, they tend to play music off of Pandora or Spotify in there. The ticket says:

"From INTERNEMAIL@companyemail: Hey, we're having issues with spotify. Not super important, but please help if you're free! thanks"

Aw, those guys are always nice to me. Maybe it's because I leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch.

An hour or so later I have a few free minutes and I head down. I check out spotify and find the issue and fix it. Jack is there and watches closely.

"We can use Spotify here?" he asks.

"Yep," I reply.

"Pandora works, too," another intern adds. Everything checks out and I leave the happy-again-they-can-play-music interns and Jack.

--

A couple hours later, I got a note on my desk. See, Boss knew I allowed people to play music and such at the office. He believed was that Spotify is a HUGE security risk, leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to cyberterrorists could come through. Boss was unhappy that I would allow such a threat to exist in our system, and ordered me to close it up.

I called Boss. When I asked who told him these incorrect things about Spotify? Oh, Jack did, of course.

I explained that Spotify was not a threat, and that Jack was simply mistaken. Jack, however, was on the other end of the line, in Boss's office, on speakerphone, and interjected: "Dude, it's alright if you didn't know about the security issue. But don't try and make me look bad for your mistake."

I'm stunned as Boss hangs up the phone after demanding I fix it.

Yes, please tell me about your security violation - /u/vzhooo

----------------------------------------

It's time to repay my lurking with a story which will hopefully provide some degree of catharsis for all:



This occurred about 5 years ago, when my company (~300 employees) had just been acquired by a much smaller company (~50 employees) with no IT staff or corporate infrastructure to speak of. We were in the process of rebuilding the full merged corporate environment, but had yet to roll out new images to our APAC offices. For reference, I was the IT manager for the Americas and APAC.



A user ($AssClown, $AC for short) from our Bangalore office (originally part of the 50 person company) had flown in for cross-training, and was using a hot desk. Not 10 minutes after sitting down, he was back up and at my desk:


>$AC: "Hi, Vzh? Do you have a second?"

>$Vzh: "Of course, how can I help you?"

>$AC: "I need admin access on my computer."

>$Vzh: "I'm afraid we don't provide admin access to corporate equipment, as that would be a violation of our security policies. What are you trying to accomplish that requires admin access?"

>$AC: "I need to install [dev tool]."

>$Vzh: "That should be available to you already, as it is part of our standard build. If you're having difficulty accessing it, please raise a ticket and one of our engineers will come by to help you out as soon as they are free."


>...


>$AC: "Ok, but I need admin access."

>$Vzh: "[dev tool] does not require admin access. Please raise a ticket for support and someone will be over to assist shortly."

>$AC: "But I also need to install [other dev tool]."

>$Vzh: "[Other dev tool] is also already available on that machine."

>$AC: "But you don't understand, I really need admin access."

>$Vzh: "No, you really don't. I would be happy to explain that to your manager instead if you would prefer."

>$AC: "BUT I HAVE IT ON MY DESKTOP IN BANGALORE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T HAVE IT HERE"

>$Vzh: "...why do you have admin access on your desktop in Bangalore?"

>$AC: "Everyone does, I NEED YOU TO GIVE IT TO ME NOW"

>$Vzh: "No. Now please return to your desk."


..some time later, $AC has now raised a **SEV 1** ticket for admin access, and I have an email from his manager explaining that not having admin access is preventing $AC from getting his work done. Cue the following email, which gives me distinct pleasure to this day:


>"Dear [Manager],
>
>
>Please be advised that I have re-priortized this ticket as Severity 5 [lowest priority], and subsequently closed it. $AC will not be receiving admin access now or at any point in the future. Admin access is a violation of the security policies that have been distributed to and acknowledged by all employees, including yourself and $AC.
>
>
>Given that it is not clear that you have read the security policies, you and $AC have been scheduled for mandatory security training next week. Please ensure that you have completed all modules by next Friday, as we will need to flag you and $AC for non-compliance if you have not.
>
>
> $AC, please treat this email as your first warning regarding use of our ticketing system. Raising this kind of ticket as a Severity 1 is wildly inappropriate, and has the potential to disrupt support for critical functions. The IT team supports multiple offices and datacenter environments, and the severity rating system for inbound tickets is intended to reflect the global impact of the issue raised. A Severity 1 ticket would be appropriate for an entire datacenter or office going offline, not for wanting the ability to install junk on your machine. Please ensure that you *actually read* the severity categorizations on the front page of [ticketing system] next time you use it.
>
>
>Kind regards,
>$Vzh"


Needless to say, the Bangalore office mysteriously lost their admin privileges that afternoon.



"THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES" - /u/chhopsky
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2coi5n/the_entire_state_is_offline_get_in_there_now_fix/
----------------------------------------

You don’t do any work on Friday in IT.  If it goes wrong, you’ll be there all weekend fixing it.

So, in the spirit of being careful, friday afternoon drinks were a tradition.  4pm Friday was beer o’clock, and as the resident only-person-not-excited-by-Crown-Lager, responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me.  No big deal right?  Except that this was the day that I finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically.  I wasn’t going to waste it.  

I did not waste it.  Our small 10-person company got rip-roaringly drunk.  Like ‘arrested for being outside in this state’ drunk.  There was Jack Daniels cans stacked to the ceiling.  Chips had fallen liberally to the floor.  Someone couldn’t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet, under ‘C’, for chicken.  It was one of /those/ drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess.  Around 9pm, after five solid hours of Aus-Spec partying, we broke off and headed into the night.  I wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour, downed another jug of beer, and smiled to myself that the week had ended.  

Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.  

My phone buzzed in my pocket.  I ran outside, tripping up the stairs as I went, managed to steady myself against a signpost, and answered.  It was the CEO.  The primary and secondary route servers were down.  I stood frozen in time for an instant, the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car, and then asked him to repeat himself.  

> CEO: YES BOTH THE ROUTE SERVERS ARE DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  

I cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had.  They, in and of themselves, were the primary thing around which our business existed, and all other things were secondary to them.  My state was by far the biggest, with some of the biggest ISPs and content providers in the country attached.  And this was the first full network outage we’d ever had.  And it was my problem.  And I’d consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant.  

I yelled .. something, and ran off in the direction of work.  It was only when I bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that I started to realise how drunk I was.  When the elevator arrived at my floor, and I bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door, I knew I was in trouble.  That hallway was only 20 feet long.  But it didn’t matter.  My wallet hit the card reader.  I’d made it.  

Habit’s a funny thing.  You get so used to the noises, clicks, beeps and responses that you realise something’s wrong in an instant.  

There was no response from the card reader.  An error, surely?  Interference, something new in my wallet?  I dug the card out, throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own.  Nothing.  Not an ‘Access Denied’ six beeps, or a ‘Card Format Unrecognised’ five beeps.  Nothing.  The lights were on, but no-one was home.  A few feet away, the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a headlight convention.  All the lights were on, the screen totally blacked out.  No beeps for keypresses.  Just .. nothing.  

The blood drained from my face.  The route servers were inside, suffering some unknown fate, our customers probably getting more furious by the minute, and I /could not open the door/.  AGAIN.  No, sod it.  I wasn’t taking any more of this security system’s crap.  I was getting into this datacentre, security system be damned.  

You all know what I’d tried before, and I knew as well, so I didn’t bother trying again.  My tools, once again, were behind the locked door, and then the light went on over my head.  

> Chhopsky: I can’t .. go through the door … I can’t .. go AROUND the door .. I can’t go .. UNDER it …. but can I go OVER it!?  

This is the logic of a drunk engineer; try all the dimensions!  There was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the DC, so in my infinite wisdom, I dragged the chair over to the wall, and lifted a ceiling tile.  Unlike the DC, where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables, the office was free and clear.  And the wall itself stopped at the ceiling.  So, pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete, I hoisted myself up into the ceiling.  

This did not work as well as I’d hoped because I was not very strong.  I kicked and pushed off the wall, scrambling to push myself up onto what I now realised was a very thin wall.  For those not familiar with a suspended ceiling, metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above, and a grid pattern hangs below it.  Inside those grids are weak, light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and plaster.  Looking at the predicament I’d gotten myself into, it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the tie-rods into the concrete.  So I’d hold onto the rods with my hands, and lying prone in the ceiling, distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors. I’d drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room, about 15 feet away.  This plan was /flawless/.  

And it worked.  For about 6 of the required 15 feet, upon which point my hands slipped, and I fell through the centre of the ceiling tile, towards the floor below.  By some insane miracle, I landed mostly on my feet, scrambling ungracefully to regain balance, coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else.  Probably asbestos.  

When the coughing stopped, I ran over to the security panel, pulled the power, and plugged it back in.  It beeped a single happy POST beep and hummed to life, making normal sounds instead of the endless buzzing it had been making before.  My access restored, I quickly found the problem - a circuit breaker had tripped, and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point, both route servers had been wired into the same circuit, rather than the different feeds on different UPS’s via different distribution boards that they were supposed to.  

With a dustpan and brush, I set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused.  It was not a small mess - ceiling tiles are about 5 feet by 2 feet, and this one had exploded.  It took about an hour.  After finally sweeping up all the mess, putting the ceiling tile I’d broken to get up there back together, and replacing the one I’d broken getting down, I walked my ass out the door, feeling smug that no-one would be the wiser for my ceiling entrance, and I’d have a grand story to tell.  

Monday morning rolled around and I was the last one in.  Aaron stared at me.  

> Aaron: What the hell did you do to my desk?  
> Chhopsky: ... wha?

I walked into the office, and stared in horror.  I don’t know what the hell I’d cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of flour with a baseball bat.  It was /everywhere/.  How wasted was I?  What did I spend an hour cleaning?  And how in almighty crap did I diagnose an electrical circuit being miswired and split with no electrician tools of any kind?  

I have no idea.

But what I did know, was how to break in. So I documented the procedure, and added it to the Tech Support Wiki.



How my first day on TaCo-Computer Store end up with a rifle pointed at my face. - /u/Crescent-Argonian

----------------------------------------

This story is pretty much almost 5 years old, but I want to vent it out, it's been causing me grief and I just need it to share it to finally feel calm.


As you may remember, I live in Mexico and things are not exactly pretty, thankfully I know how to watch my back and don't make enemies, but sometimes, destiny catches up with you.


I had finished my training and got a certificate that allowed me to work on a Computer store and repair computers, arrived early, everything normal until 1PM, Guy comes in, wants his HDD wiped clean and a brand new copy of Windows 7.


I didn't ask many questions, just took it to the back and started working on it, gave the case a nice cleaning and removed the dust, boot it up, then manure hit the fan.


I hear from the front how the front glass breaks and people started yelling my boss and the man to get the f*ck down, as well lots of insults to the client, before I could react, someone comes to where I was, pointing an AK rifle variant at me, i jump to the floor, eating that dirt and holding my hands on the back of my neck, avoiding any eye contact

>$T: WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT COMPUTER!?

>$Me: Nothing!!! I didn't get to touch it! I was just cleaning it!!!!

>$T: LIES CABRON!!!

>$Me: Check it yourself, everything is intact!

I could feel the barrel pointed agaitns me, I heard someone else come in and take the PC away, it felt like hours until they decided to retreat back and run away.

Once I recovered from the shock, i stand up and head to the front, my boss was on the phone, crying histerical, I didn't even hear the police syrens, then i noticed the client was missing.


I was not allowed to see the security footage, but the client was taken away, he was identified as a cartel member, body discovered hours later.


If it wasn't because I needed the money, i would have quit inmediatly, thakfully me avoiding eye contact probably saved my life.



Edit: I see many people doubt it, it's fine with me, but I'm going to clarify a few things.


>Everyone speaks in Spanish, I simply translated it into Spanglish for style.


>I live in a dangerous city, hence why I watch my back.


>I never learned what was in that HDD, I'm better not knowing.




Our users' collective stupidity is so strong that it protects against phishing attacks - /u/TedTheViking
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4tga44/our_users_collective_stupidity_is_so_strong_that/
----------------------------------------

A few years ago, I worked at the IT helpdesk for $organization. We just had an influx of quite a few new users. We typically see a large spike in phishing attacks during hiring season, but this particular incident takes the cake.

It was a lazy Saturday morning, and I was lounging around with the rest of the weekend skeleton crew. There was talk of ordering a pizza and pulling the N64 out of the closet to play Mario Kart. My headset beeped with the sound of an incoming call, so I excused myself to my desk.

> TedTheViking: You've reached $organization IT, how may I assist you?

> New Hire: Yeah, hi, I just started this week, and I'm having trouble activating my account.

> TedTheViking: All right, I can take a look for you, could you give me your account ID please?

His account checked out. After verifying that he could sign in and send/receive emails, I reassured him that everything was fine, and he could contact us if he had any further problems. I rejoined my colleagues, who were digging around the tech closet for the N64's RCA cable.

A few minutes later, two phones rang within a few seconds of each other. It was rare to have more than one or two calls in an hour during the weekend. Maybe the web servers were down or something.

One of my colleagues frowned, then waved me over to his desk. He wordlessly indicated to his screen, which was displaying his work email account. In his inbox, there was the worst attempt at a phishing email that I had ever seen. It was mostly a pile of unintelligible gibberish, but contained a hyperlink, the word "activate," and seemed to vaguely hint at account deletion.

My headset beeped with the sound of an incoming call. I let it roll through to the holding queue.

I asked everyone to pull up their inboxes. All of us had received the same email.

I half-jogged back to my station, copied the link from the email, then opened it in a Linux VM.

503 Service Unavailable.

I started laughing.

Our users are so gullible that their collective stupidity crashed a phishing server.

----------------------------------------

As some of you will know, I work an out of hours service desk which provides general IT support to a few different businesses out of hours when their normal IT people have gone home. These businesses are often hundreds of miles away and my access to their internal systems is usually anywhere from extremely limited to none existent.

This is a gem of a call that I received and typical of the level of stupidity we have to deal with.

**Me:** Service De--- [interupted]

**Caller:** I can't get into <building> open the door!

**Me:** I'm sorry, you're calling the IT emergency line, I can't open a door for you I'm based in <miles away>

**Caller:** SO YOU CAN'T HELP ME! WHY CAN'T YOU HELP ME?

**Me:** Ma'am this is an IT emergency line for reporting major system failure or general out of hours IT support, as I've said I'm not based on site so can't open a door for you. This was <building> correct?

**Caller:** YES <BUILDING>!

**Me:** Okay, well <building> closes at 9 pm, it's now 11:30 pm. That'll be why it's locked.

**Caller:** BUT I'M HOSTING AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL IN <MEETING ROOM>!

**Me:** Have you arranged this with management?

**Caller:** NO!

**Me:** We'll Ma'am if there's no prior arrangement with management <building> will have been locked down by security as normal as nobody knew you wanted to use <meeting room in building> out of hours.

**Caller:** WHY WONT YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR ARE YOU STUPID?

**Me:** I'm not based on site as I've already said multiple times, I'm unable to physically open a door from <miles away> for you. You'll need to speak to your management team for further assistance as this isn't an IT issue and we currently have another caller waiting so I'm afraid I'll have to end this call.

**Caller:** HOW DARE YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO HANG UP ON ME. ARE YOU STUPID? I'M REPORTING YOU TO <someone I've never heard of>

**Me:** Okay Ma'am, as I've said, this isn't an IT emergency, you're absolutely free to speak to <someone I've never heard of> however I'm ending this call now as it's not IT related and we have other people in the queue who need assistance, goodbye.

**Caller:** YOU FUC---

**Me:** *click*

For those wondering; this particular business has not provided us with any escalation contacts for their security team, if it's not IT related, we're totally free to drop that call and move on - *especially* if we have other callers queuing.

**Edit; wow RIP inbox, this post really blew up! Glad you liked it - Looks like it even featured on TFTS Quote of the Day. Thanks a lot everyone!**

Bad mouse took down a network, and almost got us banned. - /u/garycarroll
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5hzvx3/bad_mouse_took_down_a_network_and_almost_got_us/
----------------------------------------

I owned a computer shop. We donated to a local county nature center by installing a network in the campus, which consisted of several one-story buildings elevated a few feet above the ground on pilings. We ran the cables and installed the network drops (RJ ports) in the required locations, and installed and configured the routers. We have learned that it never works to give things for absolutely free because then there is no end to what people will ask for, so we asked them to pay the wholesale cost of the cable… that’s it. Everything else, including labor, was free.

About a year later they started having random ports go intermittently bad, and the problem seemed to be getting worse. They asked us to troubleshoot.  We went out, found the problem was that rodents had bitten into some cables in multiple locations. Sometimes but not always this severed one of the wires at the point of the bite. If the severed wire touched even after being severed, the connection would work, sometimes. 

This intermittent fault took several hours to figure out. Since they had not actually bitten chunks out of the cables, just bitten into it, the cable appeared undamaged visually. The way we found the problem was to run a hand down the cable looking for a kink or something and feeling the little nick. Close examination showed the bite. Once we knew the problem, it required rewiring a few runs and telling them they had a bad mouse problem, get an exterminator. 

The diagnosis and repairs took 16 man-hours on-site (two people, all day). For this we charged only for our actual cost of the replacement wire itself.

About 30 days later I get a call from the county accounts payable.  

AP: “We have found conclusive evidence of fraudulent billing on invoice (the bill for the network diagnosis and repair) from your company. Since the amount is under $100 and this is the first instance of a problem from you, if you agree with the assessment and promise never to do this again, we will ban you from doing business with the county for one year. If you agree, we will send paperwork to that effect.”

Me: “(!!) No way will I agree to that. This was a donation of our time, and we only charged for the wire so it wasn’t a freebie. We did nothing wrong. Why do you think we did?”

AP: “We ran the diagnosis and bill by our IT department as a random check. They said there was no possible way your explanation of what was wrong and what you did to fix it could be true. You can dispute this, and we will have a hearing. But if we do this and it goes against you, you can be permanently banned from doing business and may even face charges of fraud.”

Me: “I want the hearing.”

(At the hearing, before a county board of something or other)

AP to IT guy. “Look at this invoice. Do you remember us asking your opinion of this? What was that opinion.”

ITGuy: “Yes. It said the network was losing connectivity to specific drops, and the problem was due to a bad mouse. I said there was no way a bad mouse would have that effect, especially on other computers on other ports.”

CouncilGuy to me: “Do you disagree with this? Can you explain how a bad mouse could do that?”

Me: “Yes. It bites the wires.”

ITGuy: “…What?”

Me: “Look at the invoice. It does not say "a computer had a defective mouse." It says there was "a bad mouse problem." Rodents. Bit. The. Wires. We installed new wires. We donated our labor to do so, and provided the wire at cost.”

ITGuy: “That… does make sense.”

AP: “Well, OK. We’ll drop this one. But we’re going to be watching you!”





The derogatory term - /u/No_more_lulz
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6fksuz/the_derogatory_term/
----------------------------------------

A customer of ours has all their server and networking equipment support through us and the helpdesk  services from other company. I went on-site to investigate a network issue, when I was interrupted by a very aggravated employee of theirs. She insistent I would come fix some issue on her workstation like RIGHT NOW. I explain her I can't, we don't do their support. A following conversation unfolds:

    me: I'm sorry, but I don't do end-user cases
    her: WHAT did you just call me??!
    me: (puzzled) end-user?
    her: IS THAT SOME SORT OF A DEROGATORY TERM, HUH?

After that there's no calming her, she fumes on about being insulted and listens to no voice of reason. In the end I just ignore her and finish my work. The next day my boss comes to me about having received a complaint about my conduct. He says he's very surprised about the accusation as I'm normally pretty calm and professional about what I do. I explain him what had happened, my boss bursts into laughter and walks away.



Once upon a time, when old lady blocked a whole production line and blamed it on IT. - /u/EpiphanyOfThings
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/518hca/once_upon_a_time_when_old_lady_blocked_a_whole/
----------------------------------------

So, to give you some context - I was a student back then and during summer I've managed to get internship as IT Admin. The work was quite nice, I was doing helpdesk stuff but also things with servers and was involved in SAP deployment. Anyway - support of users was one my tasks.
Company was from automotive sector - airbags/seatbelts etc. and I was working in production plant connected with offices so I had to support both facilities.
One time I get a call - that was unusual, as we always reminded users to write tickets, which were responded in real-time so it took max. 10 minutes before I contacted incident submitter. 
Call was more or less like:


- "For f**** sake what are you doing with the scanners, whole line has stopped and we are completely blocked now, we can't do anything without them, they're not working and showing errors, <here just put some more f-words from 50 year old lady, production leader, who looked a lot like Shrek after a car accident>"
The line was about 10 min. walk from my office so I stayed on the phone while I was walking there.
- "Ok, tell me what is going on, calm down."
- "YOU ARE MESSING WITH THE SYSTEMS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED GOD DAMMIT, I AM WRITING TO YOUR MANAGER AS SOON AS IT WILL BE FIXED"
- "Please calm down, we were not doing anything with this since January (it was August)."
- "YEAH SURE, YOU NEVER ADMIT TO  A F$%@-UP"


At this point I was already thinking about different ways of cutting her throat open, but still played it cool. 
I finally arrive at the line and ask her to hand me a scanner. All people from production line were standing there with crossed shoulders and looked at me like "Here you go, you messed up so fix it huh" and the leader said something like "Oh here you are, now make it work after you f***ed up".


Basically, the scanner was just something like a Windows PDA with scanning module.
Nothing fancy. All she had to do was to power it up, type username/password and it was ready to go, it was all about scanning the bar codes of airbag parts.


So I take the scanner and look at the screen.
Back at her.
Back at the screen.


- "Were you asked to change password recently?"
- "YES, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SUCH BULLS**T"
- "Because the screen says that you have typed wrong password 5 times and you are always reminded that after this the scanner blocks for 20 minutes. And by the way you have 3 backup scanners so why you didn't use them? You messed up, not me. And it's not ok to talk like that to any employee of the company, so I will surely report it to YOUR manager - we have call recording enabled on our mobiles (we didn't, but she could never know)."
- "Ugh... ummm, emmm."
- "Yea, bye."

I told the story to her manager, she apologized officially the whole IT team, brought some cheapest cookies from the store and basically pretended to be sorry. Still IT was the most hated group in the company - but I guess that's the way things are.


EDIT: Lol, I expected a 100 upvotes at most, but I see it exploded a bit over my expectations, and it's not even the best of my stories :D

So this one goes back to '99 or so.  I was working in the corporate headquarters of a very large telco, responsible for the email system for HQ - about 1100 users at the time. Like all the sysadmins at HQ, I was a contractor, working through a bodyshop outsourcer. 

My boss was a guy I'll call S. S was the site manager for the outsourcer, and was the direct manager of all the contractor sysadmins.    

The customer contact was a guy I'll call J.   J was what they called an IT planner - basically a systems architect. He had dotted-line responsibility over all the sysadmins, including me.  

I also had a backup there, who I'll call B. B was a competent sysadmin, capable of handling most day to day stuff. 

We normally kept staff in the office from 8-6 on workdays, with an on-call rotation for certain specialty areas, including email.  Back then, we carried a pager (yes, an old school beeper) for oncall duty.   My oncall rotation was one week on, one week off.   This story happened in my "off" week, when B carried the pager.    

One saturday night, at around 3:30am, my home phone rang. My wife answered, and it was J calling.  She grumpily handed the phone to me.  Now my wife and I had just gotten home, having been out for much of the night with our neighbors. I was, for lack of a more refined term, positively hammered at this point.   

J informed me that there was an email outage, and that I needed to remote in and get it back up immediately, and then drive to the office to start a root cause analysis.  I informed him that I was in no condition to drive (let alone touch a production rig) and asked what B told him when he called the on-call pager.  J told me that he didn't call the oncall pager because this was way too serious of a problem to trust the backup sysadmin.  He wanted me working on this, and that if I can't be relied upon to do my job when I was needed, he'd find someone else who could, and hung up the phone.   I went back to sleep. 

The next morning I had an email from B, telling me that J had called him at home (rather than paging the oncall rotation.) It was a very simple issue - our backup software went screwy and started writing out hundreds of GB of temp files, which filled up a critical volume on our production email server.  Temp files deleted, email services restarted, problem kicked over to our backup software SME to figure out what happened.  Total downtime after B got the call was about 15 minutes.  

The next day, I arrived at the office to a note from S, my manager, asking me to come see him ASAP.  I went to S' office, and sitting there was J, who was in the process of demanding that I be fired immediately for "being drunk at work."  From there, the conversation went something like this: 

>S: But Blempglorf wasn't at work.  He was at home, and wasn't in the on-call rotation this weekend.  
>J: I don't want to hear it about the on-call rotation.  Blempglorf needs to be ready to work when I tell him to. I can't rely on an alcoholic, and I want him gone.  
>S: If he's not on call, he's free to do whatever he wants with his time.
>J: Not as long as he works for me.   

J then demands that I hand my office badge to him, and calls security from S' phone to have me escorted out of the building.  I'm in absolute disbelief at this point.  S gets up and goes off to points unknown, just as security arrives to see me out to the parking lot.  As I'm driving off, I see J's boss, I'll call her M.  M is running across the street to the parking lot.  Strange, but I was more focused on how the hell I was going to explain this to my wife when I got home. 

I got home, and my wife was sitting on the couch, just absolutely livid. Now this was REALLY weird, because I hadn't told her what happened yet. "Those motherfuckers fired you!?!?!"   I'm confused as hell at this point.  My wife told me that M called her, and that I need to call her back as soon as possible.  Come to find out, when S had went off, he was going to M's office to explain the situation and keep him from shitcanning me.  M heard from S, and freaked the hell out.  When I saw her running across the street, she was trying to catch me in the parking lot before I left to tell me to come back in.  When M couldn't find my car, she went back into the office and called the house, intending to leave me a voicemail, but got my wife instead.  M told my wife what had happened, promised to rein J in, and asked her to tell me to come back into the office to sort it out. 

So I let them stew for a while.  M called about 20 minutes after I got home.   We let her go to the machine.  S called as well, just as my wife and I went out to get some lunch.  Over lunch, my wife and I talked about how we would handle this, and (largely for financial reasons) we decided to talk to them to see if we could work this out. We got back home to 3 more voicemails from M and S. About 30 seconds after we walked in the door, the phone rang again. This time it was J, obviously on speakerphone.  J apologized to me, and asked me to come back to work the next day. I agreed, but as he hung up, I could hear M say to him: 

>"J, you're a fucking idiot." 

I worked there for another year after that, before another J fuckup made me leave once and for all.  That was a whole 'nother story.

Windows 95 is not a "Modern Operating System" - /u/chientaylor
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6dw9bh/windows_95_is_not_a_modern_operating_system/
----------------------------------------

I work for the Computer Science department of a small college. Recently, I had this exchange with a long-tenured professor.

"I tried logging in to the server to look at my mail but it isn't working." (He still uses the command line mail utility on our Unix server because the web GUI is 'f**king horrible')

Turns out he was using a piece of software so old it was a miracle it was still working with our servers at all. I tell him to install some new software.

"It says 'this software is incompatible with your current operating system'" he starts, then rants about "new programs not being compatible with modern operating systems".

I'm confused because this guy literally just received a brand new PC as part of our upgrade cycle. I go over to his office to see if there was an issue when the OS was copied onto it.

Nope. Not even using it. Instead he has his old PC from the 90s and is using the new PC as a coffee table. 

I had to explain to him that Windows 95 is not modern and that he should be using our standardized PCs. He says he is. It's a PC that was given to him before the building we're in was even finished.

The systems administrator had to step in when he realized there was a Windows 95 machine on an internal, supposedly secure network. Fireworks ensued, and there are now campus-wide rules banning older operating systems. 

This professor teaches programming in Java, C, and C++.

TL;DR; our professor was using Windows 95 and complaining that none of our modern software was working with his "modern operating system", which then caused new security measures and rules to be put in place.

As some of you may know, I work an out of hours service desk supporting multiple businesses. This particular business is an educational institute and this particular discussion took place between myself and a student;

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** I CAN'T PRINT!

**Me:** Okay, what actually happens?

**Caller:** I JUST TOLD YOU! I CAN'T PRINT...

*note - callers tone is very rude and I've reached my BS tolerance by this stage*

**Me:** Yes we've established you can't print- what actually happens? what errors are received? What does the printer do?

**Caller:** It tells me to top up my print credit as I have a negative balance of -$49 

**Me:**...

**Caller:** *HELLO!*

**Me:** I'm sorry, I don't see the issue here. You'll need to clear the $49 outstanding balance before you can print

**Caller:** But I don't owe you any money!

**Me:** Okay, are you saying this balance has been added to your account in error?

**Caller:** No

**Me:** Can you please explain what you mean?

**Caller:** I was photocopying loads of personal pictures yesterday and since then I have this balance. But I don't think I owe this as I didn't get any warnings when photocopying

**Me:**... But you're aware there's a charge for photocopying?

**Caller:** YES OF COURSE I AM!

**Me:** Okay, so I don't see why you're disputing the balance? You used a photocopier for a large job and as a result of this have a negative balance which will need to be cleared - regardless of "warnings" or not, you still used a service at the end of the day and need to pay for what you've used - you've just admitted you knew about the charge before using the service.

**Caller:** I JUST NEED TO PRINT NOW!

**Me:** Okay, you'll need to clear the balance on the account first by topping up

**Caller:** BUT THIS IS URGENT!

**Me:** It's 11 pm - I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. If you want to print you'll need to clear this balance by topping up your credit 

**Caller:** BUT I DON'T OWE YOU ANY MONEY!

**Me:** You said you used the photocopiers?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** Presumably you have the documents you photocopied?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** So you have photocopied documents that you haven't paid for. The photocopiers should not be used for personal use either. What is it that you need to "urgently" print right now?

**Caller:** I want to print a banner for a party

**Me:** So, again you're using the printing facilities for personal reasons - in clear breach of the policy you agreed to. You've also called an IT emergency line and claimed this was "urgent".

**Caller:** WELL I DIDN'T GET ANY WARNINGS!

**Me:** Thanks for calling. I'll report this to your school office for further investigation but I'm unable to deal with this on the emergency line. Goodbye *click*

I was out Christmas shopping when I got a call from the mother of friend(We will call her FM).

>FM: Hello, Zentharian?

>Z: Hello FM, How have you been?

>FM: Not well. I can't get my internet working, and I need to do my holiday shopping. Can you help?

>Z: Sure, I'll be there in an hour.

So she lives in the middle of nowhere south Oklahoma.(keep this in mind for later.)

>Z: So! What appears to be the problem?

>FM: Well I woke up this morning and the internet has won't load.

I look at her computer, and everything is fine. Now when I move to her router is when the problem becomes BLATANTLY obvious.

>Z: Well here is the problem, unfortunately I can't fix it.

Her router was full of bullet holes, about 4 of them.

>FM: Oh that must have happened when I found that snake on it yesterday. I told my neighbor about it, and he took care of it.

Snake don't like the cold, and it has gotten cold here recently, her router was warm, and it was in such a location where a snake could hide. So her neighbor shot the snake, and the router was also shot in the process.

So I give her an Netgear I keep in my work bag, this fixes the problem, and I now have bit of extra money for Holiday shopping.

Hello everyone, first time poster on this sub but I can assure you it won't be my last. Please enjoy today's pickings.

I had a person come up and say that they have been transferring some files for hours and it's only at 61%.

I have a look and find that they are not transferring files at all.

All they've done is plug their video camera in to the computer and the 61% is the level of battery remaining on the device.

The person has been watching the battery drain for hours.



Decades may pass. You're still responsible. - /u/hwaa
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4iufbs/decades_may_pass_youre_still_responsible/
----------------------------------------

Come while it's fresh! I just hung up literally moments ago!

About fifteen years ago, I was a bright-eyed coder still in college. My family was poor. Thankfully so was my country about people experienced in coding so I often did some freelance jobs to afford a living in my college city.

One of the companies I coded for was one dedicated to importing metal, cutting it based on the customer's preferences and selling it. I doubt we need to know the details, but I had coded them a simple local network program automating the preferences of the supervisors in the office and supervisors in the workshop then storing the data in their accounting program.

Today about 10am, I received a call from their boss.

> **Boss** Hwaa, hello. We need you here in <city> urgently. Your program stopped working.

> **Me** Excuse me? I do not recognize the number you're calling from. Which program of mine?

> **Boss** Don't you? I am <boss's name>.. I'm speaking about the program you made for <company>.

> **Me** Oh.. The one I made in 2000? You're still using it?

> **Boss** 2001.. Yes we are. But today in the morning the program stopped working.

Oh, nostalgia... Anyway. I decided to troubleshoot quickly, learning about the details. Thankfully I have archives for all my codes, even my first ever program coded in GWBasic.

Of course, even coded 15 years ago, a program doesn't suddenly stop working in a day. I try to find out what has changed. Nothing seems to have changed since yesterday. Maybe a blackout? No. Changes in network? Nope. Changes in any hardware? None...

It will indeed take time.

> **Me** All right, <boss>.. I guess I can't solve it from afar. I seriously doubt it's a problem in my code but just in case, I will provide you the source codes. It's possibly a simple problem in hardware and you wouldn't want to pay me for that. A local tech will do it for much less.

> **Boss** Pay you? Why should we pay you? It's your program. Fix it.

> **Me** *(after a hearty laugh)* It's a freelance job I did for you literally fifteen years ago. As you're the witness, it had worked well until this morning. Even if it was the product of a giant company, the support would have been dropped already. Think about it, Microsoft has dropped support for XP. You can't expect me to offer free support.

> **Boss** We still want you to fix it. How much would you charge?

> **Me** I'm working for another company already. First I'll have to ask for unpaid vacation. Then I'll bill all my expenses to you in addition to <rate> per day. I doubt it'll take more than a single day, though.

> **Boss** It's too much.

> **Me** I know. That's why I urge you to find a local tech and have him have a look. If it's proven that the problem is my code, I'll happily send you the source codes and then you may have it updated to your heart's content.

> **Boss** I don't understand why the passage of time should change it. It's your program. You should fix it.

> **Me** It doesn't work like that. Anyway, I'll be awaiting your call from this number. Also my mail is <mail>.

He hung up, still muttering about how it's my program and I should fix it for free.

I'm dreaming about the future now. I wonder if I'll receive a call in 20 years, telling about a faulty program of mine I coded in 2003?

**UPDATE:**

I... didn't know people will be that much interested in my story...

There are too many comments asking about the same stuff and I'm.... lazy.. Forgive me.

I got my first phone number in '99. Never changed it. The company would find me anyway, I have social media accounts with photos of mine, my name's common but surname's rather unique, my father still lives in that city and he's pretty well-known anyway..

The program was written with C#, .NET 2.0, but no, updates in .NET Framework didn't cause it, .NET Framework and the newer ones always support 2.0 without installing anything. Yes I know it's doesn't work the same with 3.5 but please be my guest and try, make a very simple 2.0 application and run it in a brand new Windows 8 computer, it'll work.

Yeah they used to use Win98 then and .NET Framework had to be installed. But if I remember correctly it was a simple 20mb file. I knew only Delphi and C# to easily make a windows application then and I've always hated Delphi with a passion.

The computers that couldn't connect to the system in question all had a horde of trojans, I suspect it was because of the cracked Need for Speed I saw in all of them. I don't know why but the computer refused to connect to anywhere local. I didn't care or investigate really, I decided I won't waste time cleaning everything, I made a factory reset, created user accounts without admin privileges and gave the admin password to the boss.

----------------------------------------

After recovery from my stroke I was in desperate need of work. So desperate I took an overnight shift at an webhost for tech support. Most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting, but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift. Occasionally I would get Gems like this.

&nbsp;

I get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone. After finally getting him to confirm his username and password I ask which website of his is down. I type the url into my web browser and surprise I get his website no issues. Next I VPN to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic PC troubleshooting (reminder this guy is losing $1K/Hr because his website is "down")

&nbsp;

It is at this point that we get into basic PC troubleshooting and the following transpired.


Me: okay are you using a MAC or PC


Cus: PC


Me: can you click on the start menu and type in CMD


Cus: I cannot the screen is black


Me: *deep breath* is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower


Cus: no


Me: *deeper breath* is the cable plugged into the back of the device, and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall. If you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position


Cus: *rustling* I think it is, but cannot quite tell


me: what do you mean you cannot tell?


cus: I can't tell it is dark


me: Dark?!? can you turn on a light


cus: i could get a flashlight, but there is no power


Me: *head desk* I assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back

&nbsp;

TL:DR; someone making "~$1K/hr" from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down...

An Update: SlimeCo brought in the lawyers, and the excrement hit the fan - /u/hrdwrsftwrmlwr
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3cmcn6/an_update_slimeco_brought_in_the_lawyers_and_the/
----------------------------------------

*In case you didn't see the edit on the other post, it was suggested I post a standalone update*

My boss spoke with upper management yesterday, and when I came into that office today (as I normally do on Wednesday), I was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards. The President, CFO, Chairman of the Board, SlimeCo's lawyer, our IT firm's lawyer, and my boss were all at the table. I found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of T.H's behavior, on my behalf.

It was explained to my boss and I that T.H, while an obvious problem, is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her. However, it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had, in fact, gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the CFO's Blackberry. We don't know how she got into the Blackberry, but what we do know is that the CFO left his Blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my IT firm. 

Some very strong words were exchanged between SlimeCo's officials and my boss. The lawyers agreed that it was, in fact, a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users, and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting.

It was later explained to me that, given the nature of the breach, we'd basically have an "all hands on deck" situation where every available tech would report to SlimeCo and start pulling servers, switches, and any other leased equipment. Estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours. (There was also the phrase "wood chipper for hard drives" thrown in there. I don't know if this was literal or a figure of speech.)

For the next two hours I was not allowed to leave the room. My boss, his lawyer, and SlimeCo renegotiated the contract on the spot. A 36% price hike, increased security improvements, and a couple other things that went right over my head.

The lawyer then pointed out that I was still well within my rights to, and asked if I would be, seeking legal action. I asked what my options were. Before he even got it out of his mouth, SlimeCo started talking about a "settlement" to keep me from going any further.

Without going into too many specifics there, a check was cut (and immediately cashed because they ain't gonna play me for no fool), The.Harpy was put on an actual probation, my boss gave me the rest of the week off — billed to SlimeCo — so I can have an actual vacation, and I'm no longer going to do any service at SlimeCo. Not the outcome I expected, at all.

Me: OK, what's up?

Me: What do you mean? Is your phone disconnecting from WiFi?


Operator: No, I just can't seem to beat this level no matter what I try. 


Me: *trying not to laugh* Uhhh, I'm not familiar with that application. Each department is supposed to have a Super User for their applications which handles tech support between the users and the vendor. Have you engaged your Super User?


Operator: *getting pissed* No, smart ass, I didn't. 


Me: *Holding back laughter as well as Jimmy Fallon on SNL* I'm sorry you're upset ma'am, but all I'm doing is trying to help you by getting you to the most appropriate channel for support of your issue. 


Operator: I thought that you may have played this game before and that you may be able to help. 


Me: No ma'am, Candy Crush isn't an application that the IT department uses or supports. 


This was the most humorous call I've gotten. What made it so funny is that the user was getting so mad that I couldn't help her and that I was laughing at her. I mean, come one. 





No, Ethernet does not make a good coat rack. - /u/nekortek
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6a56a2/no_ethernet_does_not_make_a_good_coat_rack/
----------------------------------------

Here I am, another calm morning before the storm. I sip away at my Dr. Pepper and take a bite of donut. The queue is clear and the emails are quiet. Then, as is to be expected, the phone rang. I clear my throat and pickup the receiver with a cheerful "Hello this is (me) how can I help you?" 

"Good morning, my computer won't connect to the internet."

We run through some basic troubleshooting, have you restarted the computer, is the cable plugged in, are the dummy lights on, is your computer turned on. Still nothing so I resign myself to a brisk walk down the hall to see what's going on. 

As I enter the room I begin double checking everything we talked about over the phone. The cable is plugged into the computer, the indicator lights are on, but they keep flickering out for a second. Seeing this I begin tracing the cable back to where it's plugged in. This room is setup terribly by the way so the Ethernet cable is run around the room so the person can have their desk where they want it. 

As I trace the cord I find out that it goes through a closet (not a network closet but a closet closet) and then out the other side and into the wall jack. I go to check the connection and notice the cable is tight, really tight, like I can't move it an inch tight. The effects of my Dr. Pepper start to take effect and the connections are forming. I open up the closet and find the culprit. There are coats hanging from the Ethernet cable. We're talking big, heavy coats. The poor cable was under so much strain that it was being ripped apart. I quickly removed the coats, making an internal joke about getting a load balancer for all the traffic on this line, and then made the person aware that Ethernet does not make for a good coat rack. 

Once the weight was removed everything started working again and I was off to finish my breakfast.



We just purchased fifty new laptops and need them ready by first class tomorrow! - /u/atombomb1945
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5mjwd5/we_just_purchased_fifty_new_laptops_and_need_them/
----------------------------------------

I do IT Hardware support for a college.  Coming in one morning I hear my phone ding for a new email as I am pulling in off the freeway.  I pull into the parking lot and pull out my phone to see the following email.

“Our department ordered fifty new laptops that just came in this morning.  We need IT to install the latest Windows on them along with the following software (and a long list of software follows).  These computers need to be ready to go by 10 AM tomorrow morning so we can use them for the first class.”

I check to see if this was forwarded by my Boss or his Boss.  Nope, it was sent directly to me.  No ticket, no purchase order information, I didn’t even remember seeing an order for new laptops in any department come through the system in the last month.  So I go to the office and show my Boss who reads the email and tells me that he never had a request for new laptops so he has no idea what it is about.  After a few minutes of trying to call the department with no answer I agree to walk over and see what this was about.

When I get to the Department Office I finally track down someone who knows what is going on and she leads me to one of the classrooms with a pile of boxes in the center of the room.  My heart just sinks.

There before me, a pile of new 7 inch Windows tablets with attaching keyboards sat.  I pick one up and look over the specs.  Low end tablets, barely enough memory to run Windows 10 (installed) but would never run Windows 7 (We haven’t upgraded the school yet, it was still a new OS) and is nowhere near able to run any of the software that they were requesting as each unit had about 16GB of storage.  

Needless to say, I was a little scared about this.  I asked her how these were even ordered through our system and she tells me that they by-passed the system and ordered from a web company to get a better deal.  I know that there was no reasoning with her so I ask if I could take one down to the office to get a look at it and she agrees with the stern comment of “These need to be ready by tomorrow!  Make sure it happens!”

Back at the office I show off their new toy to the rest of the staff and my Boss.  None of them are happy, there is no way we can install any software on these let alone connect them to our network so the students can log into them.  My Boss emails the Department Head asking why they didn’t go through IT to get the computers and she responds with the same answer I got earlier, they were cheaper this way.  He lets her know that we couldn’t fulfill the request and that they would be better off returning the computers and that we would work on getting them ones that would work with our network and software.  Well they can’t do that because the website had a no-return policy.  Not only that, but they hadn’t used a purchase order for it, they used the department credit card.  

So now we are stuck with fifty Windows 10 tablets that the department can’t really do anything with and the Department head is demanding answers as to why no one told her that we couldn’t use those.  For some reason they keep emailing me instead of talking to my Boss so I am getting the front end of the disaster here.  

We finally get to a work around.  The tablets are set up on the WiFi network and we have to create a generic user account for each tablet along the lines of “DepartmentTab01” and then link that user name to the MAC Address of the tablets so that no one would be able to log into the network with another computer.  They were delivered to the department a week later than they wanted.  

I wish it stopped there, but of course it wouldn’t.  

First day with the tablets a trouble ticket comes in saying none of the tablets would connect.  Get to the classroom and the teacher had written one of the user names on the board and was trying to have everyone connect to the WiFi with that one user name.  What is bad is that we had a printed set of login instructions hanging right by the board that she used.  

Then they wouldn’t charge.  Turns out the the tiny barrel plug that these things used had to pushed in all the way to get a connection.  Even just a little short of the mark and they wouldn’t charge.  None of the tablets had been plugged in properly over the course of about two weeks.  


And we still get random request for software to be installed on these.  The students won’t even use them because the keyboards are just too small to type on unless they have the hands of a seven year old.  

Why do departments do this to us?  I really wish we had a purchase system in place where all computer requests go through us.

I used to work at a small structural engineering firm (~10 engineers) as a project engineer, so I used to deal with client inquiries about our projects once we had released the blueprints for the construction of the project. Most of the time we did house projects that never presented a challenge for the construction engineer so most inquiries were about not finding stuff in the blueprints (if you have seen an structural blueprint you would know that space is a valued commodity so being a tetris player is a good drafter skill).

Then this call happened. I introduce to you the cast of this tale:

$Me: Your friendly structural engineer.
$BB:Big Boss, the chief engineer of the company and my direct superior (gotta love small companies).
$ICE: Incompetent Construction Engineer.

So one day we received a request to do the structural design for some houses that were meant to be on a suburban development, basically the same house with little differences built a hundred times. In that type of projects every dollar saved can snowball pretty fast so we tend to do extra optimization that on normal projects might be overkill, so some of the solutions we do are outside what most construction engineers are used to. That was the case for this project.

>$ICE: One of the beams you designed is collapsing. 

>$Me: EH ARE YOU CERTAIN?. Can we schedule a visit so I can go take a look before we start calling our lawyers?

>$ICE: Sure, but I'm telling you we followed your instructions to the letter, so I'm confident it was your design that was deficient.

Before going to the field $BB and I decided to do a deep review of the project, we rechecked the blueprints, ran the models again, even rechecked the calculations by hand, we found no obvious mistakes on our part so we started getting on a battle mood to shift the fault to the construction company (#1 rule of structural engineering conflict solution: It's always the contractors fault). So we put our battle outfit (visibility jacket, helmet and steel tipped boots) and went to see the problem.

>$ICE: See, the beam is collapsing! We had to scaffold it because it kept deflecting more and more!.

Effectively, we could SEE the beam getting deflected at simple sight, and that shouldn't be happening. We asked $ICE for a set of blueprints and started checking. Then we saw the problem... a column that we had considered and that was central to the design was nowhere to be found neither on the blueprints $ICE gave us or the real thing. Keep in mind that it had no *apparent* reason to exist because it functioned different than the usual designs.

$BB: Hey $Me,it appears we fucked up. The blueprints that we sent them don't seem to have THAT column, I better start calling the lawyer and insurance cause it appears to be our fault.

I was not entirely convinced, remember I had just reviewed the project so i was confident that column was on the final blueprints, we usually delivered a set of signed and sealed blueprints and a digital PDF version so they could make copies and give them to their people more easily. So i asked $ICE for the sealed blueprints... and  surprise the column was there. I was free to breath again, rule #1 was not bypassed. Now it was a matter of knowing WHO fucked up.

>$Me: $ICE, the blueprints you gave us are inconsistent to the ones we sent. Did anyone modify them?

>$ICE: Oh, sure I did. You put a column there that was too expensive and was doing nothing, I asked one of our engineers if we needed it for some code compliance reason and he said that if it was not structural it had no reason to be, so i deleted it on our working version of the plans.

That was all we needed to hear, we just went to his boss, told him he had modified the blueprints without our say so and that we were not liable for the failure. That day there was one construction engineer job opening and some happy workers got extra pay by rebuilding that part of the house.

TLDR: If an structural engineer says something is needed, then you better believe it is. Oh, and its always the contractors fault. I'm so happy to work in an industry where "The client is always right" doesn't apply.





"I can't log in when I stand up." - /u/hegbork
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3v52pw/i_cant_log_in_when_i_stand_up/
----------------------------------------

This is a second hand story told to me 20 years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then, so it could have happened in the 80s or early 90s.

The scene is a factory making heavy machinery. They are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for.

One day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says:

> I can't log in when I stand up.

The sysadmin thinks that it's one of those calls again and goes through the usual:

> Is the power on? What do you see on the terminal? Have you forgotten your password?

The user interrupts:

> I know what I'm doing, when I sit down I can log in and everything works, but I can't log in when I stand up.

The sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in. After a long back and forth on the phone, he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing can't affect logging in.

The sysadmin sits down at the terminal, gets the password from the user, logs in and everything is fine. Turns to the user and says:

> See? It works, your password is fine.

The user answers:

> Yeah, told you, now log out, stand up and try again.

The sysadmin obliges, logs out, stands up, types the password and: *invalid password*. Ok, that's just bad luck. He tries again: *invalid password*. And again: *invalid password*. Baffled by this, the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing: *invalid password*. He sits down and manages to log in just fine. This has now turned from crazy user to a really fascinating debugging problem.

The word spreads about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start flocking around it. Those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory, they are all interested in fun debugging. Production grinds to a halt. Everyone wants to try if they are affected, it turns out that most people can log in just fine, but there are certain people who can't log in standing and there are quite a few who can't log in regardless of standing or sitting.

After a long debugging session they find it. Turns out that some joker pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places. Both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password. They were both relatively good at typing and didn't look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting. But typing when standing is something they weren't used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys. Some users couldn't type properly and never managed to log in. While others didn't have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys didn't bother them at all.

>**Client**: I'm paying for this service! This is terrible, it hasn't been here for about a week now! It's usually right here on my phone. Where did it go?


*Cue about ten minutes of troubleshooting (is wifi enabled on the device [yes], do you have any devices connected to the router via cable [yes, my wife's computer, it's working fine]) etc. until*


>**Me**: Well sir, since the devices connected by cable seem to be functioning okay, we should check if it's an issue with the wifi functionality of your router. Do you have a spare router we could test with?

>**Client**: Yes, but I can't swap them now.

> $ME = Me (You know its serious when I just list me as me)

> $DA = Double agent, our spy. 

> $SN = Snitch

> $WL = Wahoo lady in her final appearance. 

> $Rec = Contracting company recruiter. 

We are getting out of the realm of ancient history and into the realm of recent events now. Another post I made about this company recently helped set off the catalyst for the endgame. 

The time of our spies party was drawing closer and the information we needed was being collected. I was still getting the reports of the snitch not playing ball with our ticketing system. Cherry picking the best tickets, ending calls before confirming tickets were resolved, making people call back later in the day for non existent server issues, and simply just not doing his job. On top of this we started collecting his email logs between him and the sales manager who was his "real" boss. 

Yes. You read that correctly. He was using company email to communicate with the sales manager who put him up to it and when we found this out it was like Jebus himself placed the holy grail onto our desk and told us to drink it up beehotches. That's one. 

Once I had everything that I needed from my team I told them to return to normal in regards to the snitch. No longer needed anything else on that front so I let my team know to watch their backs and let them know to just continue working. Everything was being handled and we were in the endgame here. We had two termination level offenses. Three more to go. 

Seeing as the snitch figured he was above the law we had been collected his usage data in significant portions. This paid off really well in a way we did not expect. We expected him to use youtube when it was unblocked on the firewall, but it never came up in his history. It was strange because he had his headphones on quite a bit even when he was not on a call. Our server guys gave us the reason for that. Seems he had made his own website to get around our youtube monitoring. It was a simple white page with a single input. When you paste a youtube video's URL into the bar it plays the video in embedded mode. Since he was not going to youtube's website, it never raised any red flags. 

I walked over to the snitch and had a small conversation with him over it. 

> $ME - You aren't in trouble but there have been rumors that you have been on youtube. I do not care whether you were or were not there. I am just warning you that people are watching. IF you are caught on youtube you will be written up and walked out. 

> $SN - Sure thing man. Thanks for the heads up. 

> $ME - No problem. Keep up the good work. 

I had the server guys set up a redirect on our firewall to a section of our domain. The website it redirected to was a white website just like his, only instead of an input box it just had the text of. "I warned you. Come to my desk now."

It took two hours after the conversation and redirect were set up for him to come to me. I already had the write up ready and simply asked him to sign it. I told him to return to his desk and get back to work. 

This was three. 

The day of the party was the day of the second write up for the snitch. Our spy sent me a text message Saturday telling me to call him ASAP. 

> $Me - Whats up?

> $DA - You need to drug test snitch asap. 

> $ME - Details. I need lots of details. 

> $DA - He brought weed to my party and smoked it with a friend of his. 

I hung up with DA and called my boss. 

> $HIT - Its Saturday. What?

> $ME - Snitch smoked weed at spy's party. 

> $HIT - *Hilarious laughter over his side of the line.* You know what to do Monday then. 

We ended the call and prepared for Monday. We were not prepared for Monday. I informed the Wahoo Lady of the issue Monday but something broke with the citrix servers causing everyone's files to no longer show up. My role in that fiasco was handling angry calls and assuring people we had backups of everything and that the server team was locking it down. Wednesday of that week was the day that Wahoo Lady made her mistake and accidentally allowed access to our database to unauthorized users costing the company millions of dollars to fix it. I refer you to my post history here for that story. This put a hold on our plans as we had to clean up the mess from $WL but she did give me a nice going away present. 

In the other thread I mentioned my final words to her were just BS talking. This was a lie. We did have our nice exchange of goodbyes and I did give her a going away hug, but between those events she gave me a present. 

> $WL - I have a solution to your snitch problem. 

> $ME - How do you know about that?

> $WL - Contrary to the aloof misguided individual you write me as on reddit, I am very good at my job. Just like you have said in your posts. 

> $ME - I change a lot of details and embellish conversations in my post to protect identities, how do you know about my posts? (Which is Ironic because this conversation has almost no edits in it.)

> $WL - I am very good at my job. Was good at my job. 

She then opened her phone up and pulled up facebook and showed me the snitch's profile. 

> $WL - Take a look at his pictures. 

I scroll through and I see a lot of pictures of the sales manager in them. A large amount of pictures of the sales manager in them. 

> $ME - They are friends? So they hang out together. 

> $WL - Yes they hang out together, go to the movies together, eat lunch and dinner together, go to six flags together, golf together, adopt puppies together. Eat dinner one night and get breakfast the next day together. Dress up as Bert and Ernie on halloween together. 

The realization of what she was saying hit me and my eyes went wide. All kinds of scenarios went through my head but I could not bring myself to actually do them. I just sat in her chair and rubbed my temples.  

> $ME - I cant use this information. As much as I do not like them and as much as I just want to use this info to light the fire and watch it rise, I will not do that. I cant.

> $WL - You do not have to because I already did it. I shared this information with both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. 

> $ME - Why?

> $WL - I like you. I do not like him. (Sales manager) Also we have rules regarding disclosing relationships between employees and management.

> $ME - You know he is married right? This has the chance to ruin his marriage. 

> $WL - It will be handled quietly. But you need to get rid of the snitch on your own first before anything can happen. Upper management bows to this guys whims because he makes the money. But if you had a sure fire reason for the snitch to get fired then sales manager will lose his edge and likely his eyes and ears into your department. In the mean time I let the VPs know of the relationship but they do not know that he is snitching for the sales manager. 

Now it made sense how this guy got hired in the first place. Sales manager put in a good word for snitch and snitch got the job. Snitch did not actually become a snitch until January when sales manager did not get his promised promotion because they expanded the IT department threefold reducing the budget for his promotion and pay bump. In his warped mind the only solution was to fire off the IT people and free up the money. 

Armed with this new knowledge I left her former office feeling physically sick and got back to work fixing the major eff up she caused. Once things had stabilized, about a week later, I went to HR again and talked to the new head of HR. I let her know about the party and let her know about the weed and told her that I needed to have him drug tested asap. 

It turns out that a company wide drug test was actually already in the works in the form of entire offices being tested over the course of the month. So they just bumped up our office to be the next one tested. We do hair tests at our work so you can imagine the amount of people who just randomly decided to cut their hair after the email went out. 

A few days later the company we hired to do the drug tests showed up at our office to collect samples. We did not even wait for the results of the drug test before we started to act. We called his contracting company and told them we wanted to terminate his contract regardless of the results of the drug test but to wait for the results to come in. We had enough to fire him without the drugs, but those helped too. Funnily enough, sales manager decided it was a good time to go on vacation the day of the drug test and had been out since they cut the hair till the end of my post. 

It took a week but he came back positive for not just weed. Speed, heroin, and zanex and a few others. This was fireable offense 4,5,6,7,8,9 through goddamn 1000. HR got with us about the positive tests and informed them of our plan to drop him immediately at the beginning of the day that Monday. They set everything up and informed security of the plan. 

Monday morning security informed me of when his badge was activated on the door. I intercepted him at his desk and did not let him work. I asked him to come with me for a meeting and to keep up. I walked quickly to the meeting room and opened the door for him. On one side of the table were our head of HR, $HIT, a lawyer for the company, a lawyer for the contracting company, and various other managers from other departments who wanted to sit in and evaluate me. (I am being groomed for management in IT) Most of the other people were merely there to observe and said nothing.  

I asked him to sit down on the other side of the table and sat right across from him. Everyone stared at him for a second before my boss started talking. 

> $HIT - We are letting you go. 

> $SN - Why? (He responded really quickly in a surprised tone.)

> $HIT - Really? You have no clue why? (He was actually mad because he read through the emails and was about to go off on Snitch)

 I laid three files in front of him quickly not wanting $HIT to lose it and blow it for us. 

> $Me - This file here is your ticket logs. You cherry pick the tickets you want to work and then dump the calls when they turn out to be harder than you thought. *I pointed to the next one* Here is your internet usage proving that you bypassed monitoring to youtube without us knowing what you were doing. You then continued to use youtube even after I gave you a friendly warning. *Pointed to the third file.* And this one is the email logs with the sales manager proving your relationship to him and your plan to gut our department for his personal revenge. You have actively worked against us since the citrix project finished and we were transferred to the helpdesk. 

> $HIT - *Lays a paper in front of him.* And this is your drug test. You tested positive for 3 illegal substances, and 2 prescription substances. They also found chemicals consistent with over the counter body detox kits people think allow them to beat drug tests. I would ask you for the prescriptions for the two you tested positive for, but that is moot since the illegal drugs have already sealed the deal. 

> $me - There is a lot I want to say right now. You have no clue how badly I wanted to say these things, but given the circumstances it would be inappropriate. You were a good migration tech, but your quality as a worker deteriorated slowly. I can see why now. I recommend you get treatment for your addictions. I have lost friends for those same drugs and I do not want to see you in the papers one day. Your recruiter will give you some information for some free drug programs if you are interested. 

I motioned to the recruiter for his contracting company to come in and he was served his termination papers. 

> $REC - Here are your termination papers. Unfortunately since you tested positive for drugs we must also remove you from our recruitment lists. We wish you luck in your future endeavors and I personally hope you get the help you need for your addictions. 

His recruiter then handed him a pamphlet for a local, mostly, free drug program for getting people clean. 

The snitch sat there with the most defeated look on his face. He was breathing so heavily I thought he was having a heart attack. Security came in and asked for his badge snapping him out of his stupor. He was almost in tears as he handed his badge. We informed them of the BYOD status on his phone and he handed it to be wiped using the iPhone reset option. (NEVER do BYOD people. EVER.) It looked like he was going to say something during this entire process but he just used breathing techniques to keep himself calm. (I think they were breathing techniques at least.) He was then escorted out of the room. 

> $REC - I need to apologize to you for the trouble my employee caused you. 

Me and $Hit both told him not to worry about it. Legal and everyone else reviewed the case and all agreed we were pretty much in the clear on everything. (Substance abuse terminations require legal oversight to insure everything was handled properly.) The tapes for the meeting were pulled and sent to the VP of IT for review. 

I sent the email logs to both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. 

Once everything was said and done I sat down and started typing up this story. Yes I started typing up this story about an hour after we let the snitch go. Halfway through typing up part 4 the VP of sales called me and $HIT into his office. He wanted to apologize for the actions of the sales manager and informed us that they asked for his resignation. All parties agreed that him leaving quietly was for the best of everyone involved. The VP personally apologized to me and $HIT and said that this company was not in the policy of creating hostile work environments for its employees. He gave us his personal guarantee that if anything happened like this again, he would squash it personally. On a personal note he asked us to unblock Facebook so his employees can stop complaining. He said that no one actually cared about that rule before. It was only there to get rid of dead weight or to trim. 

We thanked him for that and  I went back to my desk to finish typing up this story. All websites were unblocked and everyone started listening to music on youtube again as well as watching sick game footage from *insert game here.* while they worked. 

 That is that people. We won the battle, the war, and got the VP to agree to our terms. I felt so relieved that the cancer of our team was gone. I can not say I was happy because of the way it happened, but I can say that I was satisfied with the outcome. Not good and not bad but acceptable. Normally when I have seen or had to let someone go I felt bad. But the only thing I felt from snitch was betrayal and pity. He used my trust and abused my good will and it hurt all the same. But it was a different kind of hurt this time. 

FRIDAY EDIT: Even today, five days after writing this, I feel bad for the guy and honestly hope he gets the help he needs. I just hope I never have to go through this again. Now please stop camping my user profile spamming F5



When you're expected to lie to the FBI - /u/rusty0123

----------------------------------------

Players in this drama:  
$Me: me  
$BM: boss man  
$FBI: FBI agent


Some years ago, I get an offer for a side job. I nearly always have something going on the side, but it happened that I didn't right then. The guy who made the offer was a friend of an acquaintance. I didn't know anything about him and he lived about 4 hours from me. 

We spend some time talking online, and it seems like a good gig. Basically, it was writing some shipping/warehouse software. He wanted me to travel down to meet him, expenses paid. I agreed. 

When I got there, things seemed a little bit sketchy, but often people who are starting small businesses or running one-person businesses don't have much capital. So I didn't think too much about it. 

We met in a restaurant. He told me about the job...again. I patiently listen to nothing new, wondering why I had to travel for this. Then he tells me I need to come meet his client. That his client won't sign the contract until we meet. Okay, fair enough. I think his client want's to see if I'm capable. 

We go to the client's place of business. Right before we go in, this guy tells me not to worry about anything he might say. If I have any questions, ask him afterwards. 

So, he represents me to the client as an employee. Other than that, things are fine. I don't get to see any of the computer equipment (the sysadmin isn't there). I don't get to see any of the existing software (because we aren't building off the existing software). 

After we leave, I question the "employee" bit, and the guy says he doesn't want his client to know he's using contract labor. Well...okay. If you're just starting in business, you want to look bigger than you are. 

We get down to brass tacks, and the guy has a whole elaborate system set up for work production and payment. I think it's overly elaborate, but whatever. I'm not planning to cheat the guy, and if he's paranoid, that's his problem. 

He would front me some money, about a week's worth. Every day, I would upload the current source code to the cloud. He wanted to pay by the hour, so I would keep a time sheet of hours worked. 

(Personally, I think this is plain stupid. If I give a price for completed work, then I carry the extra time for mistakes. If he pays by the hour, then he carries the price for mistakes. But some people pay for work. Some people pay for the time your ass is in the chair.) 

Every two weeks, he would pay based on the time sheet hours. 

This works out fairly well until the first time he missed a paycheck. I notify him that I haven't received payment and I keep working. When I hit the one week mark (the amount of the initial advance), I keep working but I stop uploading the source code. 

I get a paycheck. 

I start uploading the source code again. 

Next time I send him a time sheet, I get a phone call. 

>$BM: You're cheating me! I can see it on your time sheet. There are three days here where you put down hours you didn't work.   
>$Me: What do you mean?   
>$BM: You didn't work these three days because I didn't send your paycheck. That's how you forced me to pay you when I didn't have the money.   
>$Me: I worked those hours. I just didn't upload the source.   
>$BM: From now on, you need to upload the source or I won't count those hours as work. But I'll go ahead and pay you this time, even though I don't believe you really worked those hours. 

My paycheck finally arrived a few days late, but without the days I supposedly "didn't work". 

I calculated where I was on hours worked vs. hours paid, taking into account the initial front money. It was good, so I kept working. When I reached the end of the paid hours, I stopped working, and stopped uploading. 

I get another phone call:

>$BM: Why are you not uploading source?  
>$Me: I've run out of money. You didn't send a complete paycheck last time. If you want me to keep working, you need to pay me.   
>$BM: You're cheating me! Do you think I'm made of money?  
>$Me: This is what we agreed. If you'd rather switch to a pay for work delivered, I can do that.   
>$BM: No! You'll cheat me out of more money. I can get some kid out of high school to do this for less than I'm paying you. If you don't start working again, you will lose the whole project.  
>$Me: Why don't you go find that high school kid? 

That was the end of that. Or so I thought.

About a month later, I get a frantic phone call.

>$BM: You have to fix this!  
>$Me: Fix what?  
>$BM: The client's computer system has been ~~hac~~compromised. Everything's gone!  
>$Me: Don't you have another employee now? The one that took my place?  
>$BM: But he's just a kid. He can't fix this!! Can't you at least give me some suggestions?  
>$Me: What exactly happened?  
>$BM: It's the sysadmin. He got fired. He took down the whole system.  
>$Me: Why did he get fired?  
>$BM: We didn't need him anymore. The system was up and running fine. After he left, he remoted in and erased all the operating systems.  
>$Me: Well, you've got backups. Reload everything.   
>$BM: We can't. The sysadmin got the job because he had unlicensed copies of all the operating systems we needed. He used those to set up the network. Now we can't reload without buying licenses.   
>$Me: ....

After I hung up, I had a good laugh, and realized that I'd dodged a bullet with that company. That was the end of that. Or so I thought. 

Early one Saturday morning, I'm sleeping in. Enjoying a well-earned day off. Phone rings. 

>$Me: Hello?  
>$FBI: This is Special Agent xxxx from the FBI. I need to ask you a few questions about this company.   
>$Me: I don't work for them anymore.   
>$FBI: It concerns the computers that were ~~ha~~compromised.   
>$Me: I wasn't employed there when that happened.  
>$FBI: Yes, but $BM got some advice from you at the time? He says you can confirm the incident.      
>$Me: He did call me. I talked to him for about 10 minutes.  
>$FBI: Good. I need to verify exactly what he told you about the damage done.  
>$Me: He told me the operating systems had been erased.   
>$FBI: Yes. Can you estimate how much monetary damage was done by erasing the operating systems?  
>$Me: Well, none. They didn't own the operating systems, so it's not like any property was damaged or stolen.  
>$FBI: They didn't own the operating systems?  
>$Me: That's what they told me. They were running unlicensed copies.   
>$FBI: He told you that??  
>$Me: Yes. He told me that the sysadmin, the person who ~~ha~~compromised the system, brought the operating systems with him. After they fired him, he took the operating systems back. But he said they were unlicensed, so I don't know that they legally belonged to the sysadmin.   
>$FBI: Thank you for your cooperation.

DM: (continues crying)

Me:  Alright.  So when you worked on your presentation it was a powerpoint right?

DM:  Yes... (sniff)

Me:  Did you have it saved on a network drive or just on your computer?  

DM:  i'm not sure.  I think just on my computer... (sniff)

Me:  Ok, I'm willing to bet you saved it on the network drive and didn't know it. 

DM:  Ok.  

Me:  I have to search like a million folders.  Can you tell me the name of presentation?

DM:  Yeah.  It's  ********************

Me:  Ok.  Let's see.  2016 right?

DM:  Yeah  (sniff)

Me:  Got it!  

DM:  Shut up..... (sniff)

Me:  It's ***************** for 5/12/16 right?

DM:  Oh my god..... 

Me:  Ok so i'm going to save this.  Send it to your email.  You have a phone or ipad right?

DM:  I have both!  

Me:  Ok. Are you in a conference room? 

DM:  Yeah!  

Me:  Do they have wifi?  

DM:  Yeah... I think so.... 

Me:  Ok.  Try to find out the wifi and connect your ipad to it. 

DM:  Ok.  Emails are coming through.  I see yours...... Oh my god...... OH MY GOD!!! 

Me:  There ya go!  I don't know the connection of the conference room but there should be a way to airplay your powerpoint from your ipad to the tv or whatever they have.  If they're mac compatible..

DM:  Yeah if not this is fine.  Oh my god... (crying)  I can't believe it.  You saved me! 

Me:  haha.  not a problem.  Glad i was able to help

DM:  Next time I'm at the office, you're getting beer and a long hug! 

Me:  Sounds good.  Hope your meeting goes well. 

DM:  .........................

Me:  Ok Bye? 

DM:  hahahahahahah.   So.  My laptop just turned on.... It wasn't plugged in and I guess the battery was dead.  ha ha ha.....

"It's 600 pixels but why is it so huge?" - /u/mdude04
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4wfty2/its_600_pixels_but_why_is_it_so_huge/
----------------------------------------

Realized this may not be "tech support" in the usual sense but it's a fun story anyway...

Client provided a PSD file that she wanted converted into an HTML file. PSD was 600 pixels wide. I sliced and diced the file, converted live text where possible, uploaded the HTML page to the server and provided her with the URL.

I then get a frantic email which turns into the below conversation:

Client: This is terrible! Everything is so much bigger. It looks nothing like the PSD I gave you.

Me: What do you mean "so much bigger"?

Client: It's huge! You have to re-code this so that it matches what I provided

Me: (utterly confused) So that I know exactly what the problem is, could you provide a screenshot of what you're seeing?

Client: (Sends a screenshot of Photoshop and Safari side-by-side. They look identical)

Me: They actually look the same to me. They should both be 600 pixels wide. I didn't alter the PSD at all

Client: (Tech savvy enough to know how to "inspect element" in Safari) Okay, yeah, it's 600 pixels but why is it so huge?! This is unacceptable. I'm going to send this job to someone else to re-code.

At this point I have no idea what to say or do. I decide to look at her screenshot again and this time I notice her Safari window says "33%." Evidently the zoom setting on her Safari browser was at 300%, but in the screenshot she sent me, it was scaled down to fit on the screen (which defeats the entire purpose of sending a screenshot to show the discrepancy).

Me: Can you make sure you're not zooming in in your Safari browser? Your screenshot looks like that might be the issue

(No reply)

Several hours later, client emails me again for another project, not mentioning this issue at all.

Me: By the way, is that other project approved?

Client: Yes.

No apology or sign of humility. This client does this kind of stuff all the time. I'll never understand how she is smart enough to know about pixel width and analyzing image properties, yet still pulls out stuff like this.

Edit:

Wow. Okay, I had like 62 karma in my 2+ years on Reddit before this. Now I have over 3,200 from one thread in one day. And Reddit Gold! Thanks, guys!

----------------------------------------

A tale from the other side - my friend bought a netflix box for a tv, and when it wouldn't work, asked me to come set it up.


I couldn't get there until after work, and when I did it was working. She said she called google to fix it (it was not a google product, nor does it use any google services) so I thought she googled the company number and had them fix it. 

I wanted to show her it wasn't google she called, so I checked the caller ID. 

It was google. After a while on the phone a google tec support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free. 

I guess google really is a helpful service.

Everything I print comes out of the fax machine! - /u/Krieg
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5j6hcg/everything_i_print_comes_out_of_the_fax_machine/
----------------------------------------

Long time lurker, first time poster.  This happened last week:

$Boss:  Hey Krieg, I didn't know we could print on our fax machine

$Me: Sorry?  That's not a printer, just a fax machine

$Boss: Nop, it prints as well.  (while showing me some pages that came from the fax machine) I printed this document and it came out of the fax machine instead of the printer.  I was surprised myself.

$Me: It is not possible.  The fax machine it is just a fax machine.

$Boss: Well, then from where this came from?

$Me: I have no idea, but the fax is not a printer.

$Boss: I will prove it to you.  I will print this other document.

$Me: Go ahead.





10 minutes later




$Boss:  Hey Krieg, the fax machine it is finally printing.  It took a bit but it is now printing that document I told you.

$Me: WTH?  This can't be.  The fax machine is not a printer.  Let me see and I try to figure out what's going on.


I printed out the journal report from the fax machine and I see the last entries are from a number in Hong Kong.   I check the number and it belongs to our branch in Hong Kong so I give them a call.  Finally the puzzle is solved.


$Me: Hey $Boss, I know what's going on with the fax machine

$Boss: You realized it is a printer as well?

$Me: Have you been to Hong Kong lately?

$Boss: Yes, I was there last week for some meetings.

$Me: Did you try to print anything while you where there?

$Boss: Yes.

$Me: How did you manage to get your print outs to come out of the printer over there?

$Boss: I had to configure their printer in my notebook

$Me: Have you checked you are not still printing in the Hong Kong printer?

$Boss: Why?

$Me: Well, you have been printing all the time in the Hong Kong printer.   The printer is besides a secretary who thought your documents where very important so she faxed them to us.

LTL; FTP. None of the names I'm giving here (besides my username) are real. I work for a surgery center. So does Sandy. Sandy is a very kind (gullible, evidently) older lady who mans the switchboard phones. 

This is about the day I upgraded Sandy's computer. 

This is about the day I made Sandy cry.

>Glass: And there you are. Do you have any questions I can answer about your new setup before I go work on the other tickets today?

>Sandy: Well, how am I supposed to use it? 

Did I mention this was a particularly off-kilter day, and I had deployed the machine without a keyboard or mouse?

>Glass: Oh, these new machines don't require keyboards or mice anymore. There's actually a neural implant, very low power and completely painless. It makes it a truly wireless experience, and the procedure only takes about 45 minutes. We have you booked for operating room 7 with Dr. Smith at 12:15

>Sandy: But...but I... 

>*At this point, Sandy's eyes start to bug out and she bursts into tears.*

>Glass: Oh my God! I'm so sorry! I'm Joking! I just forgot your keyboard and mouse. There is no implant, I was pulling your leg. Please ~~don't go to HR~~ forgive me! I'm going to go get your keyboard and mouse right now!

This was many years ago now, but I still feel bad about it. Luckily she calmed down (and found it funny) a few minutes after I explained that I was joking. 



Liz I don't like you like that - /u/baldandoldinIdaho
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5p4pm8/liz_i_dont_like_you_like_that/
----------------------------------------

This happened during my tenure as a T1 at a mid sized call center in 2001.  Like most call centers a ticket was required for any IT problem mainly because we had around 500 users on line at any one time.  Most of the users understood this and followed the rules pretty well.  Except for the new supervisors. Most were in their early 20s and it was usually their first time in any type of position of power (hey they now got an inbox/outbox and their own stapler they must be important).  

Liz lived up to this to a ridiculous degree,  every problem led to a panicked call to us followed by a dash to our office when told  to open a ticket.   "This has to be fixed right now" she would wail "I'm a supervisor".  Since most of her problems would be resolved with a couple of key strokes I decided to nip this problem in the bud. 

As soon as she would call I knew I had a couple of minutes as she made a mad dash down the stairs to pound on our door to plead her case in person.   Now Liz was just a stunningly good looking girl so most of my co-workers (also in their 20s and as awkwardly nerdy as you would imagine would jump to help her). I however was in my early 40s and fortunately immune to her looks.  So I took to using remote desktop to fix her problem while I knew she was heading towards our office (locking her computer was not necessary I guess). I would begrudgingly follow her upstairs to "see" the problem which was already fixed.  She would swear that it wasn't doing whatever before and that it must have fixed itself.   

After about the fifth time I did this I dropped this on her.  "Liz I'm a happily married man and I just don't like you like that". "If you don't stop trying to get me alone like this I'm going to have to go to HR". 

Liz started using the help desk after that and me at my co-workers shared a laugh every time one of her tickets came in.



I seriously hope I never have to do this again - /u/Hexerade

----------------------------------------

I work in a call center for one of the major cell phone companies. This happened sometime yesterday. This is more of a vent than not.

A woman calls in, must have been at least 75 years old, she's looking to disconnect a line. I start my spiel about trying to save the line (required), but it just doesn't feel right. I ask her why she wants to disconnect the line, and she tells me that her son passed away. I'm obligated to tell her that if she doesn't back up her content before I disconnect the line and she trades it in, she would lose that content. She just responds with "Oh... I guess I better do that then..."

I'm helping her connect this phone to her laptop, and she's going through pictures and videos and the music that her son helped her set up. I hear the videos in the background as she watches them again. She tells me all these wonderful stories about him, the trips he took, the things he did. I'm genuinely having a tough time keeping it together, because he sounds like a great person and she sounds so sad and lonely, but she kept her composure so well.

Call takes about two hours. We finally finish moving everything from her phone over to her laptop and I submit the disconnect. She thanks me for my time and for listening to the rambles of an old woman. I take a breath, and it comes back out as a sob. I didn't even realize that I had been crying for most of the call. Super has been listening in on the call for a while and he tells me to just go home early if I want, he'll cover if anyone asks what's going on.

I love my job. Really, I do. Sometimes it's hard. Calls like this make me wonder if I can keep doing it.

Edit: Thank you for the support, and thank you kind gilding strangers. I wish I could say this was a normal occurrence, but I can all but guarantee you - not counting supervisors (who are awesome and super supportive), there are not many people in my building who would have been that kind or accommodating for her.

Edit V2: Got a message from my super a few minutes ago, wanted me to check my surveys for the day and then call in. She left an absolutely glowing survey for me, asked if there was any way she could thank me personally or speak to me again directly. Called the super after and he said he would be submitting a personal recommendation that I be considered for a promotion because of the edit mentioned above. I feel like this kind of behavior should just be standard between customers and CS reps, regardless of what's going on in either party's life...

Edit V3: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up like it did. I really just wanted to get it written down and off my chest. Truly, thank you guys so much for being here, you're all awesome. ;w;

Edit V4: I'm back at work now. Boss and I caught much less flak over it than we anticipated, and his recommendation has been considered. I have two weeks to prepare a presentation going over why it's important to "not be a robot" (why it's okay, even good, to go off script sometimes, as well as how to stave off the ennui that comes from call center work) for HR and the site operations managers - if I do well, it will be looked at for use in future training, and I'll get the job I've been aiming for. Wish me luck! ;w;

Edit V.Final: This is the last one. Things have been happening so fast I've barely had time to breathe. The presentation went well, and I got my promotion... I'm starting my training for it this friday. Feels like everything is finally falling into place. I seriously didn't expect this much response or support. If anyone is still reading this, thank you so much.

----------------------------------------

I have been working my way up the food chain at the little IT company I'm with. The clients I deal with I treat much like I did customers at Starbucks. Compassionate, caring, empathetic, blah blah good customer service, blah blah. And this has put me in good favor with all of our clients that I've dealt with. 

One in particular is a mid-size, regional company that specializes in giving sociopaths a lucrative opportunity to exploit people less strong willed than them. I'll let you determine the field. They are not my primary "station" but I help out there when the ticket queue gets overloaded. We can call them SlimeCo.

Most of the folks there that I deal with, while slimy in general, are quite pleasant towards me. I'm the cheerful guy with the laptop who doesn't make promises and just does what needs to be done, unlike the three other burnt-out techs stationed there who make hard deadlines they never meet. But there is one woman here who is beyond help. 

Ever see that episode of Kitchen Nightmares or whatever it was that had the husband and wife pair that the wife was just completely convinced she could do no wrong and that everyone was out to get  her? That's this woman. Not literally, but a bit-for-bit duplicate. She is a problem for everyone, and my pleasant demeanor doesn't mean shit to her because I'm just trying to ruin her life. I avoid her like the plague because I have more important things to deal with than her fifteen tickets about the same goddamn bullshit that has been resolved over and over again. We'll just call her The.Harpy from here on out.

This past Saturday, the fourth, I'm up at my friends' cottage for the long weekend, when I get a call from a number I don't recognize. I answer, because at 2am it could be important. Something could be wrong at home, or with my family or what have you.

>Me (groggily) "Uh...hello?"

>The.Harpy "Finally someone fucking answers. Aren't you guys on call or whatever?"

>Me "I'm sorry, who is this?"

>T.H "Who the fuck do you think it is? It's The.Harpy from SlimeCo. My goddamn laptop keeps restarting."

>Me "How did you get this number?"

>T.H "Why does that fucking matter? You're IT. You're on call. That's how it works. Fix my fucking laptop or I'll have your job."

>Me "This is a personal cell phone and I'm not on call, ever. We don't have 'On-Call Support'."

>T.H "If I can get a hold of you, you're on call. And this laptop you gave me isn't working. It keeps restarting and I need it to do my fucking job."

>Me "I'm 200 miles away, I have no internet access so I couldn't remote in if I wanted to, and it's a holiday weekend. SlimeCo. is closed until Tuesday."

>T.H "WELL I WORK OFF HOURS AND I HAVE WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE SO GET IN YOUR FUCKING CAR AND FIND SOME INTERNET AND FIX MY FUCKING LAPTOP"

>Me "I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I'm not going out looking for an internet connection at 2 in the morning on a holiday weekend just because you decided you need to work right this second. I'm not even a dedicated SlimeCo. technician. I'm only there when support is needed, and I haven't been in the branch since last week."

>T.H "I DON'T GIVE A **SHIT** YOU WORK FOR US AND YOU WILL FIX MY LAPTOP RIGHT NOW. I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY HERE TO DO IT."

>Me "You know what, you're right. I just need you to submit a ticket so I can get to it in the system and I'll head right over to the nearest Starbucks."

>T.H "THAT'S WHAT I FUCKING THOUGHT. YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH THESE KIND OF HOOPS TO GET SHIT DONE AROUND HERE. YOU SHOULD JUST BE GRATEFUL YOU HAVE A JOB AT ALL YOU FUCKING DIMWIT"

>Me "Yep. You're right. Go ahead and place the ticket and I'll head right on over to Starbucks and remote in and get this all taken care of for you right away."

>T.H "GOOD."

She hangs up. I immediately put my phone on silent. My laptop is sitting comfortably in it's docking station back at the main office, 200 miles away, the nearest Starbucks is about 40 miles away, and I go back to bed, about ten feet away. 

I check my phone in the morning. 

61 missed calls. 

14 voicemails. 

Two hundred and thirty-nine emails. 

Alternating between personal attacks fired off like text messages, and submitted tickets. Funny how her laptop was stable long enough to submit around fifty tickets and another 180-ish emails.

I blocked her number after that.

I got into work today, and my boss had a similar situation. She kept calling his phone, long into the night. 

>Boss "You're nicer than I was. I just told her to enjoy her holiday weekend and hung up."

*I wonder if Starbucks is still hiring*

***An Update: SlimeCo brought in the lawyers, and the excrement hit the fan.***

My boss spoke with upper management yesterday, and today when I came into that office (as I normally do on Wednesday), I was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards. The President, CFO, Chairman of the Board, SlimeCo's lawyer, our IT firm's lawyer, and my boss were all at the table. I found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of T.H's behavior, on my behalf.

It was explained to my boss and I that T.H, while an obvious problem, is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her. However, it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had, in fact, gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the CFO's Blackberry. We don't know how she got into the Blackberry, but what we do know is that the CFO left his Blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my IT firm. 

Some very strong words were exchanged between SlimeCo's officials and my boss. The lawyers agreed that it was, in fact, a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users, and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting.

It was later explained to me that, given the nature of the breach, we'd basically have an "all hands on deck" situation where every available tech would report to SlimeCo and start pulling servers, switches, and any other leased equipment. Estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours. (There was also the phrase "wood chipper for hard drives" thrown in there. I don't know if this was literal or a figure of speech.)

For the next two hours I was not allowed to leave the room. My boss, his lawyer, and SlimeCo renegotiated the contract on the spot. A 36% price hike, increased security improvements, and a couple other things that went right over my head.

The lawyer then pointed out that I was still well within my rights to, and asked if I would be, seeking legal action. I asked what my options were. Before he even got it out of his mouth, SlimeCo started talking about a "settlement" to keep me from going any further.

Without going into too many specifics there, a check was cut (and immediately cashed because they ain't gonna play me for no fool), The.Harpy was put on an actual probation, my boss gave me the rest of the week off — billed to SlimeCo — so I can have an actual vacation, and I'm no longer going to do any service at SlimeCo. Not the outcome I expected, at all.



Will fix laptops for food - /u/novafix
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/60ulr3/will_fix_laptops_for_food/
----------------------------------------

A few years ago I was sent to our Italian office where the 3 Italian IT guys were to train up their new IT Support Guy there on how to manage his help desk stuff.  Things were going really well and one day they decided that we should all go out for a traditional Italian meal - a Turkish Kebab.

We got to the kebab shop and I'm trying to read the menu and getting some help from the team.  The guy behind the counter can fortunately speak English and he wants to practise so we get talking and I place my order of 1xAwesomeKebab.    

He then asks me what an English speaking guy is doing in Italy so I make the mistake of telling him that I'm here doing "IT Stuff".

That was all he needed to hear.  About 15 seconds later I have this knackered old laptop running Windows 7 with a Turkish operating system that "won't work" and there's an error when he tries to do stuff with it.  

So I tried to help as he was preparing my food and I like helping people anyway.  My kebab turns up and I slowly ate it over the course of about 20minutes while I tried my hardest using context and experience to figure out what was wrong from the description he gave me that "something was wrong with his internet connection and it didn't work".

I managed to work out that it looked like his network card was broken and non-functioning and that he could maybe try re-installing it from the original disks he had or get a cabled connection so he could get the drivers if he didn't have the disks.  

He seemed happy with this and brought us our bill.  He went round the table collecting the money and when he got to me he said 

"Not you my friend, today, you eat for free!"

The kebab was totally worth the impromptu tech support.

I am currently working from home as I recover from cancer.

My kitchen table is my Service Desk and my flat is my office.

It's nice!

My partner normally leaves the flat before I start, and returns after I leave, meaning I can happily work away on my own.

A few minutes ago I was helping a user with a DMS search issue.

My partner had come home early. And quietly. 

She whispered hello as she realized I was on a call...

I screamed straight into the receiver and fell off my chair. 

The user, when I explained what had happened, began laughing hysterically and telling those around him about the "screamer from IT".

Can't wait to return to the office now...

Hell no. Old lady, old laptop, my senses are telling me it's gonna be pain for next few hours.

> Woman: Sir, I don't have Internet on my laptop! Everything was alright before I took it to XYZ IT support for cleaning!!!

Its getting even worse. Knowing XYZ, rival IT support in same small city, they screwed something pretty bad, as it happened many times before.

> Me: Let me look at it

I turn laptop on. It booted super fast, like it was not old Dell but new NASA machine. It was at raw state from another IT support, Chrome, some random antivirus. But that's none of my business, turning on Chrome. Uhh...

> Me: Ma'am, it looks like everything works well here, Internet is working alright, you sure it's not problem with your connection?

Woman looked at me like I offended her ancestors

> Woman: CAN'T YOU SEE SIR, THEY DELETED INTERNET FROM MY COMPUTER!!!

Oh. I got it... Someone in XYZ deleted **Internet** Explorer from her laptop, changing it with Chrome. Poor woman didn't had clue what Chrome is.

> Me: Oh yes. I see...

Guess what. I took back Internet Explorer icon on the desktop and made it Chrome executable.

> Me: Done! You can check it ma'am

She takes the laptop

> Woman: Hey, it's back! *doubleclick* And it looks much better now! You, sir, you are a magican!

I charged her 20€ for this. I don't even feel bad.

----------------------------------------

I used to work deskside support for a big Pharma company.  One morning I was working on a VP's PC that was totally down when I get a message from the help desk that another emergency case just arrived.  I call in to get the details thinking that it will be the next thing I do after I take care of this VP.  Surprised by the info, I have to have this conversation.

>Me (to VP):  "A worker nearby has a PC down with data on it needed for an FDA audit that is coming in 90 minutes.  Um, I know your PC is still down, but can I go?"

>VP: "Go."

After running to the other office only 50 yards away (when was the last time you saw anyone from IT running as a part of their job?) I find the PC in question: not hard, it is not often four people crowd near a PC.  After confirming the story that I got from the help desk and letting them know I left a VP down and out for this, I stow my lecture on the criticality of network storage for later since they seemed properly scared about the pending audit already. I size up the issue:

1. Windows won't load at all.  It stops at a blinking cursor after POST.
2. BIOS sees the hard drive fine, there are no errors to use.
3. Using a boot floppy, DOS thinks the hard drive does not exist.
4. Worst of all, the PC is making an awful clunk..clunk..clunk noise on the side where the hard drive is located after every reboot.

Now, I've been in front of three or four thousand different PCs at this point and have never heard this sound before.  I'm thinking: "Dead hard drive, we are so screwed."  The PC was partially covered with stacks of papers so they didn't move or drop it and it was getting ventilation.  After about twelve reboots and I listen closely to the noise:  it sounds like the hard drive read arm tapping against the drive case about once a second.  I'm about to rip out the hard drive to take it back to my desk to try a desperate data transfer attempt when a small corner of my brain tells me:

>*You know, those hard drives are mounted vertically.  Maybe if the drive arm doesn't have to fight gravity it will start working again.*

The larger part of my brain that thought this was a silly waste of a few precious minutes was overruled as I moved papers and monitor aside and stood the PC on it's narrow side.

Incredulously, the PC booted to Windows and I could log in like nothing ever was wrong with nary a clunk from the hard drive.  

I look at the clock: 50 minutes until the FDA auditor was to arrive.  Likely not enough time to transfer all of the data off of this drive.  While the main user was logging in I provided the most stern lecture I have ever given to those assembled.

>DO NOT turn it off.

>ONLY touch the mouse and keyboard.

>DO NOT touch this PC case at all.

>DO NOT even breathe on it.

>THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON WHY THIS PC IS WORKING.

>You will show the auditor the data if asked and do nothing else with this PC.

>When the auditor leaves you will immediately copy that data to your department's network drive that you can get to from any PC.

>You will then call me and I will swap out this PC for another.

> In the future you will ALWAYS store data, ESPECIALLY critical data, on the network drive.  We will always give you more network drive space for data.

With that I walked back to the VP, hoping I would get lunch sometime that day.



USE YOUR EARS YOU IDIOT - /u/ElegantGooseFam

----------------------------------------

Friendly(ish) neighbourhood ISP rep here, just got off the phone with this one and wow, I'm still kinda speechless. Me for me and cust for our beloved customer.

>Me: Generic totallynotarobot greeting

>Cust: MY INTERNET IS OUT FIX IT NOW!

>Me: I'm doing well thank you how are you?

Typically if the customer starts off by yelling at me and not acknowledging my existence as a human, I will endeavour to fix your problem ASAP to get you off the phone, or fix it as slow and painfully as possible. Depends on my mood, I was only 1 coffee into the day at this point and in no mood for this kind of shit. 

>Cust: ARE YOU LISTENING? USE YOUR EARS IDIOT I SAID HELP ME

>Me: I'll certainly take a look for you, what was your account number?

>Cust: I don't have time for this, just fix it, send someone out, I don't care, but do it fast or else.

>Me: If you want a tech dispatched I'll need your account number or at least your address

>Cust: STOP WASTING MY TIME AND GET SOMEONE HERE NOW

>Me: Can I at least grab your name?

>Cust: YOU DON'T NEED MY NAME, JUST FUCKING FIX IT YOU IDIOTS 

>Me: Lady, you're asking me to send a tech out and refusing to give me an address to send him, and i don't even know your name. Give me something to work with...

>Cust: YOU DON'T NEED MY INFORMATION I GAVE IT TO YOU WHEN YOU SIGNED UP WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO HARD <inaudible screams> 

>Me: Is there anything else I can assist with today? I'm not wasting anymore time. You've made it clear you don't want to work with me so I'm going to terminate the call now.

>Cust: WAIT! My name is Carol!

>Me: Well you have yourself a wonderful day Carol. *click*

Told the supervisor just in case, shot me a cheeky grin and said to jeep up the good work. 

How hard is it to at least be respectful to ther person you want to help you?

EDIT: I will be uploading more of my interactions with these oh so wonderful customers when I get the time. I also have a pretty large backlog of stories that come to mind at my older job in the electricity industry. Stay tuned my dudes!

EDIT 2: "Jeep it up" stays. For good.



"can you install us some keyloggers?" - /u/CptFaustas
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6d0b6w/can_you_install_us_some_keyloggers/
----------------------------------------

So yeah, this happened quite some time ago, but here it goes:

Me - me?..
SPB - Super psychotic boss, or shitty piece of brick, whatever.

Got an email that wen something like this:

>Hello,
>I need to have keyloggers installed to all computers, except mine.

Wtf right?

>Hello SPB, 
>we can't do that - it's illegal to collect any sort of personal info without required forms and approval from <agency>.

A normal reply, close ticket and move on right? Nah.

>Me, i need to log everything they write, someone is putting slander on me on <website> and i need to find out who, cause it can only be my employees. YOU DO IT RIGHT NOW OR I WILL HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT COMPLYING TO MY DEMANDS!!! (this last sentence is word for word and it was in caps).

Now to note, SPB wasn't MY boss, he was just a boss for some company, he never quite grasped that at most he could terminate his contract.

>Dear SPB,
>As i said again, what you are asking for is illegal. You can contact authorities about slander, but this advice is about as much as i will help you. 

Don't remember the exact reply, but i was threatened with termination, that i will never work ever, that he will find me and deal with me (a peach i know) and after that one i blocked him out and just forwarded it all to higher ups, no idea what eventually happened with him, and don't really care.

EDIT: since people are asking i will try to find out what happened to the guy!

EDIT2: dude stopped paying because we werent providing service he didnt sign up for, then refused paying debt so contract was severed. Lost a bunch of employees and is on the verge of bankrupcy, but i think he is no longer the owner.  Will update if i find anything more. 

EDIT3: after forwarding he got charged for every single thing with hourly rate (makes sense why he didnt pay the bill, hourly rates should have ruined him) and also with the generic "happens again we terminate and yada yada".

----------------------------------------

I'm not personally in tech support
I work in the HVAC low voltage control industry. I do everything from pulling wire to programming and everything in the middle. I work with IT a lot due to our controllers needing port forwarding / VPN / etc.

I was working in an office building today, converting pneumatic fan powered boxes and vav boxes to DDC. This consists of removing air lines and replacing them with wire, adding transformer, controller, relays, etc. I rolled my cart into a new area and popped a ceiling tile to see what was next. Suddenly a woman in a cubical gasps. She slowly looks up at me and asks what I'm doing. I explain. 

Her: 
> "well, as soon as you did that my computer slowed down."


It took me a minute to process... 

I assured there was nothing I did that would cause her computer to slow down. Her response?

> "You're letting the WiFi escape! I'm calling IT!!"

Guy from tech support shows up. Her computer is hardwired. Weekly server update. 



FFS: It's 4AM - /u/DivinePrinterGod
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5lfpqd/ffs_its_4am/
----------------------------------------

New Years Day.  There is no "on call" over the christmas / new year period as we're upgrading the financials server and the email server so they're all down.  Down and physically unplugged.  The staff come back on 16th, and they know that the system is down because they were all physically told when we closed on the 21st.

I've had one or two drinks.  Not many, but enough to make me merry.  I'm in bed next to my GF and almost asleep when my personal mobile rings.  It's the Accountant.

>ACC: I'm trying to access Financials and it says not responding.

>Me: Happy new year to you too.  It's 4AM and I'm not on call.  This can wait until we get back in.

>ACC: Look DPG, we have a serious issue.  If I can't access this system then we can't trade in January.

I dimly remember what he said when I answered.

>Me: You do know that Financials is down because we're upgrading it.

>Acc: Who signed that off?  I didn't.  I need it up now.

>Me: The MD signed it off.  If we don't do this, then we're not compliant for the next financial year.  I think the request came from you originally.

>Acc: Not good enough DPG.  How long to turn it back on?

>Me: I'll need to sober up, then drive to work, perhaps four hours work.  Let's say midday at the earliest, maybe even 2PM.

>Acc: Fine.  I'll expect it by 2PM.  

He disconnects.

I fire the MD a quick text explaining the situation and go back to bed.

When I woke up at 11AM, there was a VM from the Manager stating not to worry about it, then a second from the Accountant stating what a piece of shit I was for going above his head and how he can't do his job blah blah blah.

I'm back at work on the 9th, so will let the boss know what the accountant said in his voicemail.

**tl; dr:** Planned maintenance prevents the accountant from accessing financials at 4AM on new years day.  He calls me to get it working and I go above his head.



The time I was caught hacking the refrigerator... - /u/TaedW
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2o5taw/the_time_i_was_caught_hacking_the_refrigerator/
----------------------------------------

Many years ago, I got a field report of a few systems that were turning themselves off during the night without warning or seemingly a reason. We had some temperature-monitoring software that would automatically shut the system down if it got too hot, and the logs showed that was what was happening. But it was November and the systems were in snowy regions, so too-hot didn't make sense.

A quick look through the code showed me the problem.  The programmer was reading the current temperature as an unsigned byte instead of a signed one (as the data sheet for the part specified), so that an actual temperature of -1° C (which is crazy cold for a system) was being read as 255° C, and so it would shut down immediately.  Later investigation found that the affected systems were in unheated loading dock areas.

The fix was, of course, easy, but testing it required putting the system in our kitchen freezer (with the various cables coming out for power, the monitor, and so on). The CEO walked in while I was sitting there with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor seemingly hooked up to the refrigerator and just said, "I don't think that I should ask what you're doing."




Your webmail got me fired - /u/FlexMoneyBiceps
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6fzgx7/your_webmail_got_me_fired/
----------------------------------------

$FMB = $FlexMoneyBiceps, this handsome hunk of flesh, not a robot, you can't prove it, and working L1 ISP support during this time

$CC = $CrazyCustomer, an ISP customer who doesn't understand how webmail, or craiglist, in the end, works

--

So this is a story from when I used to work at $RelativelyMediumSizedISP. $RMSISP, like all ISPs stuck in the 90s, provided (and still provides, though I think they're trying to get away from that) email addresses for all of their customers, with webmail to come with it. I'm abbreviating the story a bit and cutting out the filler- it's been a while, and I can't exactly remember the exact words.

Phone rings.

-
---

$FMB: Hi, this is $ISP tech support, how can I help you?

$CC: You [fantastic people] got me [fantastically] fired! I can't even access my webmail, you [amazing people]! I just wanted you to move it from my home computer to my work computer!

$FMB: I'm sorry to hear that- but it's webmail, you can access it from any computer just by going to (webmail address) and putting in your username and password.

$CC: Yeah but it's on my [fantastic] work computer now! I want it on my home computer! You guys need to stop doing such a [swell] job and do your [goshdarn fantastic] job!

$FMB: Is it not showing up in your webmail? Do you have a client that you have, that's set to POP3?

$CC: I don't use a mail client or whatever! I just want my [goshdarn] email! And I want you to pay my lost wages!

--

--

Obviously, this isn't how webmail works. She doesn't want to hear it, though. I am curious at this point how the 'fired' bit is going to come in- I know it will somewhere along the line.

--

--

$FMB: Okay, I can definitely help you with accessing your webmail. Let's get a browser window open- whichever you prefer, IE, Firefox, Chrome... (I always listed these just in case they didn't know what a browser actually was.)

$CC: No! Your tech came out here, moved my webmail from my home computer to my work computer, and then my job [fantastically] fired me for it! You need to send someone back out here to fix your [swell] job, you [fantastically amazing people]!

--

--

Checking her records, she hadn't had a tech out since installation. What?

--

--

$FMB: Ma'am, we haven't sent anyone out to your location since you got your internet installed. Who did you have come out?

$CC: One of your techs! I told you! I'm going to quit my service you [goshdarn swell...bags]! I demand you reimburse me!

$FMB: Did you call in for tech support first? (She doesn't have any recent calls logged either.)

$CC: No, [smart donkey], I went to craigslist and just had one of your internet people come out!

--
--
--
***what.***
--

--

--
$FMB: ...Ma'am, let me get this straight. You went to Craigslist and hired someone to move your webmail, which is on our servers, from your home computer, to your work computer?

$CC: Yes! How is that so hard to understand? I hired one of your internet people, and now my job has fired me because they said something about 'unauthorized access' and 'tampering with company equipment'! What did your [amazing, fun-loving] tech do?!

$FMB: Ma'am, people you hire from Craigslist aren't associated with $ISP. We don't do anything with Craigslist.

$CC: It's on the internet! You're the internet company! I want you to come back out here, get my webmail off my old work computer, and I want you to pay me for the job you made me lose! Now!

$FMB: ...I can help you with getting your webmail, ma'am, if you're willing to troubleshoot and work with me here, but we will not be reimbursing you for your job.

$CC: Then I don't want to talk to you, you [fun-loving amazing swell bag]! Get me your supervisor!

--

--

--

So I escalated it up. While I had the lady on hold, and was explaining the situation to the L2 who had to deal with her, I legitimately had a hard time explaining it because I was laughing so hard. I loved these kinds of calls- we can't help you, we won't help you, you won't let us help you, and you're nuclear fire mad. It's the best. Then I got promoted a week later and my job ended up consisting almost entirely of these types of calls.


-
---

End of the story- she didn't let the L2 show her how to get into webmail, she threatened to sue about the reimbursement, and then she got stonewalled right to legal after making that threat. I don't think she called in ever again.




Our newest employee just told us he appreciates what we do. - /u/Scott_IT
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5jx8an/our_newest_employee_just_told_us_he_appreciates/
----------------------------------------

We have about 150 employees and two IT guys. I'm the helpdesk/Jr. sysadmin and the other one is my supervisor. This means we have dedicated in-house Helpdesk/IT who can help employees at a moment's notice.. The employees who have been here for awhile or haven't worked many other places often become irritated with us because they constantly walk into our office, call us, or catch us while we are walking around, but we tell them to submit a ticket. These people can't get it through their heads to simply submit a ticket.

Our newest employee is an older man and has been here for about two weeks. He's submitted two or three tickets about trivial things, but after today's ticket which I provided a solution for within a minute of the submission, he came in and told us how much he appreciates how quickly we do things. He said he wasn't used to that. I guess he's worked at places without in-house IT support or 3rd party support. I don't have much experience myself, as this is my first job out of college, but it was a nice gesture to hear that since the long-time employees here don't seem to appreciate us.

That's it! Happy Holidays tfts!

Edit: This got a lot more attention than I thought it would!

9 out of 10 businesses fail within ten years. Half of those that failed did so within the first year. Ever wonder why? - /u/ReachTheSky
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/58fm1c/9_out_of_10_businesses_fail_within_ten_years_half/
----------------------------------------

Long ago, I worked as tech support for a company that provided a service primarily aimed at small businesses. Most of the people that called were small-time CEO's and partners. I worked there for years and answered probably hundreds of thousands of calls and emails from people and businesses all over the world.

I think I've gathered a large enough control group to make a few assumptions as to why so many of them fail. Starting with the most prevalent issue and going down:

* Severe lack of planning, organization and awareness of their own operation
* Lack of knowledge (read: common sense) and a problematic mindset for tackling issues
* Zero patience. Unrelenting need of instant gratification
* Ridiculous budgeting
* Problems taking simple advice, mostly due to ...
* ... assumptions that being self-employed somehow makes you royalty

That being said, here's a list of some of the most common problems the self-employed world would call us about.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Down For Days**

We billed on a monthly basis. Our clients put their credit cards on file and we auto-billed them. Credit cards inevitably expire (though some card companies allow billing on expired cards) or get canceled, lost, stolen, etc. so it needs to be kept up to date. When payment hasn't been made for a month, services get shut off.

Sometimes they would completely forget and the service would get shut down. And they wouldn't notice. Sometimes for days/weeks/months. Of course, we would send notifications before and after shutting them down but those went unanswered. We couldn't call every one of them because we had millions of clients and nowhere near the manpower.

When they'd eventually catch the drift, they'd call. They were absolutely *livid* and using all sorts of colorful language. But the reality is that there's no one to blame but themselves. How on Earth they wouldn't notice their *entire business* coming to a grinding halt for so long is beyond me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Use It Or Lose It**

Sometimes people would sign up for our service, then decide they want to go a different direction and forget to cancel the subscription. So our system would go on its merry way of auto-billing them each month. Sometimes it would take months or even years for them to realize they're paying for something that's essentially useless. If you're a monstrous corporation, I can understand a few things falling through the cracks but for a small operation or a start-up, it can be devastating and sets a horrible precedent.

As a matter of fact, this was such a common occurrence, we kept track of the record holder. When I left, it was *NINE* years. A small home-based business actually paid for a service they didn't need or use for nine years. Ouch.

The biggest thorns were the people that would call and say "I never used it so give me a refund." That's not how it works. It's a service that was provided. Your choice to use it or not use it is irrelevant. They disagreed. Our go-to analogy was "If you didn't watch TV at all this month, your cable provider won't refund you." They still disagreed.

**EDIT**: I seem to be catching a lot of flak for the person who unknowingly paid for nine years. Let me clarify this one a bit - we keep track of customers after they realize it and contact us. As I said, we had millions of accounts. We couldn't sustain the kind of manpower that would be required to go through *every single one* and individually contact people that we assumed had forgotten.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**If It Ain't Broke**

I'll be honest - our service wasn't the easiest thing to configure. Not that it was badly designed. It was actually very well put together but had a *ton* of features and was very sandbox-like in nature which understandably overwhelmed some people. 80% of the calls we had were from people needing help figuring features out and getting help configuring it to work for them.

Sometimes there were people that would not stop messing around with the damn thing. For some reason, most of them were the very unsavvy type too. We'd spend hours talking and jotting down what exactly they need, configure the thing for them, ELI5 the best way we can as to how it works and how to change something should the need arise and then set them on their merry way. Then they'd go in a start pressing random buttons, mess it all up and call in with a chip on their shoulder. Cue the *"we're losing thousands and thousands of dollars by the hour and it's ALL YOUR FAULT!"* nonsense.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Catch-22**

*sigh*

Here's a conversation that'll put this one in perspective:

* Customer: Why is my service down?
* Agent: It looks like your bill hasn't been paid. We need a payment before it can be reactivated.
* Customer: I can't pay. I don't have the funds. Can you give me an extension please?
* Agent: We gave you one last month. I'm sorry we can't do it again.
* Customer: But without the service, I can't make money and won't be able to pay you.
* Agent: ....

Our team had conversations along these lines at least a half a dozen times a week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**That One Rockefeller Quote**

A lot of times, business partners would have a bad falling out. One of them would elect to leave and the other would vow to continue the operation on their lonesome. Sometimes it was so bad, they wouldn't even be on speaking terms. Sometimes the one that left is the one that opened the account and put it under themselves rather than the business (tsk tsk). The one that decided to stay would call in to get the account updated and gain control of the service. But there's a problem. We have no idea who you are and without verification, we can't give you anything. If your ex business partner isn't giving you the time of day, well, you're SOL buddy. :(

Sometimes they would actually fight over control of the business. One would call in and change things, then the other would call in and change it back. One would put it under a hard passcode lock and the other would get absolutely LIVID and demand access and demand to speak to management and so on.

Sometimes disgruntled employees or partners would go in and utterly *destroy* everything that was built before disappearing. Cue all sorts of chaos and panic as they call in and literally break down while we're trying to put everything back in order.

Business is a nasty business.

Oh no, it turns out that the student was printing lined notebook paper rather than buy a $0.99 notebook.

"But I want an i7!!!" - /u/Cyrillus00
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32otlj/but_i_want_an_i7/
----------------------------------------

Deep in the bowels of the southern US swamps there lies a collection of half-nerds, half-rednecks...



**Cast:**

**Me:** The hero whose sanity is tested greatly by those he tries to save.

**BenchTech:** An old Navy vet who doubles as both in-house support, phone support, and procurement for the business.

**MMA:** Former MMA fighter who now works as one of our front two receptionists. Really nice, but can come off as really direct and intimidating.

**i7Kid:** You'll see...

**i7Mom:** You'll cringe...

**EldSon:** i7Mom's eldest son.



Now normally I hate getting problem customers so early in the morning...but this one ended up being quite hilarious/sad. I am normally the second one to arrive at $DeepSouthIT in the mornings. BenchTech always gets there way before opening time to catch up on his paperwork and take inventory in case we need to order anything...



Now before I get into the meat of the story a small note...we mark up our prices compared to where we buy them. Fairly standard practice I know and it's not by much, just enough to make a reliable profit. This goes for anything a customer asks us to order as well.



Now onto the show! I arrived this morning to find a car already parked out in front of the shop and waiting for the doors to open at 8:00. Since I am an on-site tech primarily I normally park up front as it is easier to get in and out of where our building is located. As I get out the lady in the car sees my company uniform and gets out. She is followed by a little freckled pre-teen. I tell them good morning, they seem friendly enough as they greet me back.



I open the door and, for lack of other things to do, I flip the open sign on and decide to man the front desk until MMA gets here.



>Me: "So how can I help you folks this morning?"



Without saying anything the kid puts a sheet of paper on the desk. I take it and look it over...it's a list of PC parts along with a vendor name and price. It's some pretty decent hardware too, LGA2011 i7, SLI 980s, 1200W PSU, something you don't expect to get from a 12 year old...Also very expensive...



>i7Kid: "I need this built."


>Me: "This is a pretty nice computer, also expensive, what are you going to use it for?"


>i7Kid: "A few video games."


>Me: "Is that all you are going to be using it for?"


>i7Kid: "Yeah, mostly Minecraft, League of Legends, and a few shooter games."


>Me: "Well this will definitely run all those, but this build might be a little overkill for that."


>i7Mom: "Look we already discussed this with his older brother, he works with computers too, and that's what we want. We already did the research for you and those are where you can get the parts cheapest from."


>Me: "Well I thank you for doing that ma'am, but if we order all these parts it will come out more expensive than your total listed here because we ultimately mark up our prices on hardware we order except on pre-built machines that we sell up front."


>i7Mom: "That's ridiculous!!! They're our parts why should we pay extra for them!?"


>Me: "That's just our policy ma'am, we wouldn't make much a profit on custom built machines if all we charged for was the labor, so if we have to go through the trouble of ordering in all the parts, especially from so many different vendors. If these were parts we had in stock I'd be willing to negotiate, but all of this is pretty non-standard high end equipment. Now if you want to order the parts yourself and bring them to us we'll be more than happy to just bill you for the labor then."


>i7Mom: "I don't have time to go hunting for all those parts and who knows when they'd get shipped here?"



At this point i7Mom is looking a little upset, I can see BenchTech looking around the corner from the back area, and MMA walks in and takes her seat at the second front desk, and i7Kid is currently playing on the demo computer we keep up front.



>Me: "If you'll give me a moment ma'am I'll tally up all these parts and tell you what our price would be for it."



She huffs, but nods and lets me do the math...Afterward we'd gone from a significant amount of money to a fairly hefty markup with the price as high as it was. I tell her and at that point the vein throbbing in her temple became that much more prominent.



>i7Mom: "You're trying to rip me off aren't you!"


>Me: "No ma'am I'm trying to give you some options to better fit your situation. This build, if we build it, will be an amazing piece of technology. However for what it is being used for we can build you a significantly cheaper machine that will achieved nearly the same results."



At this point her phone rings and she steps off to answer it. MMA rolled over and asked what was going on, which I fill her in to the details. She's not a tech, but she pays attention and understands the role various parts play in PC's, so she got the jist of what i7Mom's issue was. At this point i7Mom came back up to the counter and holds her phone up to me.



>i7Mom: "This is my oldest son, he is the one who told us to buy that computer."



Taking the phone I say:


>Me: "Hello this is Cyrillus at $DeepSouthIT."


>EldSon: "Did she just say I recommended that monster of a PC?!"


>Me: "Yes sir, they said you recommended these as the parts best fitting your little brother's situation."


>EldSon: "Son of a b****...alright look I told them very, very clearly that he did not need that build, that I could put together a list of parts that would work great for him, but he wanted what I have and I let my mother pressure me into making that list. I do a lot of graphic work for my company so my computer needs that horsepower, his doesn't. Do not let them talk you into building a PC that expensive, my parents don't need to go spending that kind of money right now. They can afford up to about two grand right now."


>Me: "I understand sir, I can definitely work with that."


>EldSon: "Great...thanks...here is my phone number in case you need my help convincing them."



I took down his name and phone number in case I needed the leverage...which I am glad I did...



>i7Mom: "Well?"


>Me: "Ma'am he and I are in agreement that the parts you have listed here, which he uses for a *business* machine, is too much and too expensive for what you want."


>i7Mom: "You're lying, he told me those were the right parts."


>Me: "He said those are *his* parts for his *work* computer. Your son there will not be doing the kind of things that EldSon is doing. As I said I can save you a LOT of money if you will let me put together a parts list based on what we have here and what I can order from our usual vendors where we get discounts and the mark ups may actually come out cheaper than standard."



That seemed to get her attention and she agreed to at least let me make another list of parts and our price. I checked what we had in stock and put together a good listing for her. It was a decent build, high end i5, one of MSI's better gaming mobo's, 8GB RAM, AIO water cooling...you know, the kind of front line gaming build that can tackle just about anything you throw at it short of massively demanding games and applications.



I showed i7Mom the specs and, more importantly, the $1600 price tag which included assembly labor. She looked at the price difference and said,



>i7Mom: "Wow...and you're sure this will be good?"


>Me: "Yes ma'am, that's in line with what a lot of gamers these days use. In fact for the games he told me he was playing most this build is probably still overkill."


>i7Mom: "That's awesome, how long would it take you to have this ready."


>Me: "End of the week at the least, we need to order two of the parts on this list as we don't carry those standard. The rest we have in house and you won't have to pay the extra shipping costs on."



At this point i7Kid got bored of messing with our computer and decided to come up to the bench and look at the parts list I had made. His mom and I were in the middle of discussing payment (as for things we order we have to get that in advance, the rest can be paid on pickup).



>i7Kid: "This doesn't have an i7..."


>Me: "No, but this particular i5 will be more than enough for what you need."


>i7Kid: "I want an i7..."


>i7Mom: "Honey the nice man said you don't need it for the gam-"


>i7Kid (In the most bloodcurdling and high pitched screaming voice you can imagine): "I WANT AN i7!!!"



He then proceeds to put on a pouty face and glare daggers at his mother. She glares right back, then looks at me,



>i7Mom: "Any chance you can get an i7 for the price of the i5?"


>Me: "...Not a chance."



I know I was technically fibbing here as we did have some older i7 procs, but after that little display I just wanted to feed the fire.



>i7Mom to Kid: "You're not getting an i7."



For the next five minutes all we could hear was the glass shattering screaming of what could have passed as a dying hog. All the while there were repeated sobbing cries of "BUT I WANT AN i7!!!" over and over and over...



In the end i7Mom ended up having to drag her son out of the shop and they drove off. I don't know if they will be back, I don't know if I *want* them to come back...



MMA got up and stood at the window to watch them leave and, as she turned around and saw the demo computer she balked, blushed, and waved me over (Should note here that the computer monitor faces the front display window).



The kid had half a dozen tabs of porn opened...



Now I *really* hope they don't come back.



EDIT: To clarify the $1600 price tag broke down like this. $1200 in hardware, $250 in markup (I have no control over this) and $150 in labor for estimated assembly and OS installation.



Edit 2: Welp definitely wasn't expecting this kind of reaction, glad everyone enjoyed it. Only my third story so I'm still trying to get reddit formatting down. Thanks for the gold/all the comments!



"Yes, your job is tech support. But you need to make more sales." - /u/-dun-goofed
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6665tc/yes_your_job_is_tech_support_but_you_need_to_make/
----------------------------------------

Background: Website hosting tech support. Company was purchased by a large scale corporate empire notorious for making once-great hosting platforms suck. 

When I first started my job, I loved it. I recruited a ton of my friends. I genuinely enjoyed the work. I liked my customers, and my customers liked our company. We used to get praised all the time for being super friendly, not being in a rush to get them off the phones, and *not harassing them to make a sale when they needed our help.* I had been told on multiple occasions things like "I'm just so thankful that there's no pressure from me to buy anything. It's really nice, so thank you!" 

I get pulled into the Assistant Manager's office with about 5 other people and my supervisor. He sits us all down and says he wants us to beta test something new. Sales. There's some immediate concern that a lot of employees in this department like Tech Support because we're awkward and we aren't natural salesmen, and we like to just fix things. He sugar-coats it, saying we'd *only* focus on sales relevant to what the customer called in about. For example, if they need help buying a domain name, we could up-sell domain privacy, or a second TLD (.org, .info, .biz...) - the key here was that it needed to be relevant to their issue, so we aren't putting a lot of pressure on them. The goal was to be *helpful* and he stressed that our job is still tech support, and he profusely denied that they were trying to make us another sales team. Because "tech support is the most expensive department" (DUH! It's supposed to be.) 

So we try it out. We log our sales in a spreadsheet for a while, noting which customer we talked to, what product we sold, etc. and they share our results with management and corporate.

And then they roll this out to the entire department. They change our back-end customer interface to have a big sales menu in the top corner where we can click a button to say which service we have recommended to them. If the customer buys the product we recommended within a certain window of time, we would get credit for that sale. Many of our techs hated it and called it early that this would ruin the laid back environment in the department, and it would annoy our customers. Management didn't care, and insisted that our jobs would never be dependent on us making enough sales.

Fast forward a bit. I switched from the live chat team to the email team. One thing we observed was that we would recommend a product/service, and the email would go 10+ hours without a response, then the customer would sign into their account and buy the service, and we wouldn't get credit for that sale because our window to make the commission was 8 hours, and responses from customers over email just *aren't immediate, like the phone and live chat customers are.* Plus, with email customers, they usually have a very specific reason to contact support, like an error in their email, or a programming issue with Wordpress, and it made it feel a lot less natural to up-sell products with those kinds of support tickets. I didn't bother making sales anymore, even though management was pushing them very hard at this point. They set a minimum sales amount to $500 before we would receive a commission check. So if you only sold $499 worth of products and services, you still wouldn't get a commission check.

My supervisor posts a message in our chat room, asking for some honest feedback about why we have the lowest sales in the department. He wants to know what our concerns are, and if he can think of ways to make it better, he'd pass that feedback up to Assistant Manager to see if they could make it happen. So I mention how it's more difficult to make sales when their question is very specific, and we don't have opportunities to make small talk with customers while we wait for responses from other departments or senior technicians to fix their issue, and I mention how the 8 hour commission window may be too short for emails, suggesting that it may be easier if our commission window was 12-24 hours to accommodate for how long it takes for customers to purchase something when we have up-sold via email, in comparison to the often instant yes-or-no response over phone/chat.

Then I get an instant message from Assistant Manager. He's pretty aggressive about my feedback regarding why I don't try to make more sales. He says I need to try harder, he brags about some other guy in the department on the phone team who happens to be a total natural salesman and he's making these giant commission checks, and he says I need to stop complaining about the circumstances that make it harder for me to make a commission. (Okay... let's get this straight. I wasn't complaining. Do I like making sales? No, that's why I picked tech support instead of sales. But it's not like I complained to my supervisor - he's the one who asked us why we don't even seem to try.) 

I clarify that sales from our team would probably be better if our sales window is bigger, because I had seen instances where I sold a service to a customer but they had waited to buy it until the next day, so I didn't get a commission. 

Assistant Manager: "Well, if you want, I can just change your commission window from 8 hours to 0 hours. How would you like that?" Yep, he just threatened to remove my ability to even make a commission at all... because I shared my opinion with my supervisor at his request.

I stared at his message for a moment, considering telling him to go sit on a cactus and quitting my job right then and there, but I was pregnant and we had baby stuff to buy. "Go right ahead, its not like I make a commission anyway."

I quit shortly after this exchange, because I was nearing the end of my pregnancy and struggling to not tell customers to go take a long walk off a short pier. It was a huge relief to not worry about having to come back to that work environment after having my baby.

Edit: Okay people, let's stop playing the "which hosting company is it" game... ultimately, they're all the same. 



This server is too critical to move it! - /u/BarServer
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kzxck/this_server_is_too_critical_to_move_it/
----------------------------------------

This is a story from my traineeship. We had an MS Project server that was actively used by many people from our company. Project leaders, sales, developers.. Everyone.  
So it happens that we finally got a new nice server room, with decent AC, redundant power lines, no carpet on the floor, etc. The last server that needed to be moved into this room was the MS Project server.  
The movement date got postponed again and again as, surprise!, it was too critical to move it. Each time we would schedule a movement appointment someone would say: "Yeah, but I have my deadline on that day. I need it." even when we switched the timeframe to weekends it was like: "Yeah.. But.. You know.. I wanted to work on that weekend to finish something important."  
So, our Head of IT got pissed, and here is how he solved the situation:  
  
> **Head of IT:** /u/Barserver, follow me, take my phone. If it rings, answer the call and just say I'm on it.  
> **Me:** Uh.. Huh? What? Err.. Okay.  
> *Taking his phone, walking behind him to the old server room.*  
> **Head of IT:** Ok, remember: Only say I'm on it. NOT what I'm doing. Understood?  
> **Me:** Understood.  
> *Head of IT starts to cleanly shutdown the MS Project server, removes all cables and starts putting it on our small transport cart.*  
> Phone rings for the 1st time.  
> **Me:** Hi, yes, we know the server is down. Head of IT is on it. No, no. I can't give him the phone he's busy fixing it. I'm taking his calls to let him work. Yes, we will notify you when it's working again. Bye.  
> Repeat this for like 10 other calls.  
> *Head of IT and me arrive at the new server room. He puts the server back into, connects all cables, powers it up, verifies that everything works.*  
> **Head of IT:** Done. Finally. After 3 fucking months. Why can't these people accept a scheduled 30min maintenance window, but a 30min unscheduled downtime?  

And that's the way I learned how to move servers that are just "too critical" to be moved.  
Surprisingly no one asked ever again why we never scheduled another date to move the server. Not even after the old server room was renovated and used as the companies "recreation room" (kicker, food, comfy couch, etc.). I explained it to myself that people generally just don't care HOW it is done. They just want that it does what they need. This time we used this for our advantage.



"God no, never install google on my machine" - /u/RedSilentxRain
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4tbuo3/god_no_never_install_google_on_my_machine/
----------------------------------------

So the other day my dad asked for me to help him with his computer (windows 7) and clean out some "viruses" for him. I work as a database developer and part time as an IT consultant on weekends, so I deal with stuff like this all the time, so I said sure, whatever, I'll help you out. Anyways so after I remove a bit of malware, I notice he's using Internet Explorer, and casually mention that he should probably consider using Firefox or chrome. To this he responds, "god no, I wouldn't want to have a Google operating system on my computer". At first I think he doesn't know what an operating system is, but after questioning him he explains to me how chrome only works on chromeos, safari only runs on macs, firefox is evil and only Internet Explorer runs on windows. Determined to explain to him that he's blatantly wrong, I go to install chrome, and he freaks the fuck out, makes me uninstall it. After an hour of fighting me, he chastises me saying "you'd think someone who uses computers as much as you would know not to install google. I guess there are some things you just don't understand", and calls his work, which us a place that uses me as a consultant   and tells them not to use me anymore. Fml



Turn off the computer, unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day. - /u/Loud-n-creepy

----------------------------------------

Today everyone on our network received an e-mail in foreign language with suspicious attachment (Word document with macro, with encryption virus). It is called Locky.

I receive a request to look into suspicios e-mail from user.

Me: Have you opened the e-mail? Everyone has received a suspicious e-mail with encryption virus, so you should not open any e-mails from unknown senders.

User: No, I haven't opened it yet.

Me: Good. Let's delete the e-mail using Shift and Delete, so it is not stored even in Deleted Items folder.

User: Wait a second.

Me: Alright! Just delete it and be careful with such e-mails in future.

User: It had a document attached, but it is only gibberish. Could you look at it?

Me: You opened the attachment?

User: Yes.

Me: Well, turn off the computer, unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day. Tomorrow we will take your computer, it will have all its files encrypted and unusable.

User: Why did you do that?

Me: I told you it is a virus and not to open it.

User: I'm writing a complaint.

She then hang up.

------

Edit: Today, my boss listened to recording of the phone conversation and praised me for being so calm. Computer was indeed disconnected and our engineers are working on it (there are few more computers that were infected from these e-mails). Recording of the phone call will be used in investigation about the user, probably will result in firing her. As it turns out these e-mails have been sent to all 6700 work stations that our company support. Our guys managed to block couple of thousand e-mails, and we have warned everyone about the virus, but probably going to have quite a few more of idiots opening the virus.

Edit 2: User faces charges for knowingly putting computer system at risk, which can result in fairly large fine, and almost certainly leads to firing. Also it might even be considered a criminal offense.



Crazy Request from HR - /u/Lightzeaka
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6br78p/crazy_request_from_hr/
----------------------------------------

So I got a call today from a user that doesn't work in the corporate office. Basically, they are unable to log in to see their pay stub, which is done through a web-based SSO portal. I asked a coworker, and it looked like the user was terminated. I asked the user if they were an active employee, and they said yes. I eventually tell the user I'll call them back after I look into the problem a bit more. Then I got in contact with one of our HR people to try and find out what's going on with this user's account. The HR rep told me that the user was termed, and asked me to reach out to tell the user.

Yup, our HR department asked me, a helpdesk tech, to reach out to a user and tell them that they have been fired. Guess that's IT's responsibility now.



"We've outsourced you, we'd like it if you got a job at the company we've outsourced to." - /u/Epidilius
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5duztg/weve_outsourced_you_wed_like_it_if_you_got_a_job/
----------------------------------------

FTP, LTL, other FTP, HTTPS, etc. Disclaimer: this is less a tale and more a farewell.

I worked for an international real estate company. They are massive. I was contracted to help consolidate their different database (they had over 20, jfc) in the summer months about two years ago. There was myself and my two coworkers taking care of the IT needs for 1/3 of a country (Eastern region) of staff (about 10k). It was a nightmare, and I'll post some stories eventually. 

This particular farewell tale requires just a little bit of background info:

While there, I made an internal help desk portal so users could do things like reset passwords and make tickets, merged the DBs, made a small GUI program so they could manage their new DBs (all three of them), and automated a bunch of small tasks. I also convinced the CTO to hire an IT company to provide a remote tech from 1:00PM to 5:00PM. Things were so great when I left, and we all kept in touch. I was even hired a couple of times to add to the portal and DB manager. This isn't to say they were incompetent, they just had no time to do anything. 

Fast forward to last month, when I get a message from one of my coworkers (now good friend). The CTO, in all his infinite wisdom, decided to cut the IT department. For the whole country. He plans on getting the help desk to cover the whole intranet for the whole country, and is going to hire a second remote employee. 

"This is pretty standard stuff," I hear you say. I know, and I apologize for taking so long to get to the best part. In the same email in which he fired his IT team, he said:

"I think it would be a great opportunity if *Employee* got a position at *Company Outsourced To*. It would allow us to efficiently move away from a physical IT presence while maintaining our current knowledge levels."

When my friend sent me this, my jaw hit the floor. I thought about posting this then, but decided against it, and I'm glad I did, because it goes better. 

This past week, the CTO sent me an email, asking if I could make the internal help desk work for the other two regions (central and western), as he doesn't "understand how to integrate Active Directory with Powershell and JQuery like you do, Epidilius."

I said sure, but multiplied my rates by 20 (yes, twenty). I'm currently waiting to hear back. I will update this when I do. 

Until then, a toast to all our brothers and sisters who fell at the ignorance of another! 

Edit: What are words

Edit 2: Today, I got an email from one of the accountant ladies we shared an office with (I have no idea how she got it either). The big man ended up hiring a college student at minimum wage ($11 per hour here in Canada), and apparently he has so little clue as to what he's doing he has asked this lady to help him with a ticket another accountant lady made (she wanted her monitors switched). 

The decision making process of the C class boggles my mind. 

Also, for clarity: the little old accountant ladies were amazing. Not exactly computer literate, but our best users. We (IT) shared a big corner office space with them.  They had a dozen cubicles and a couple of offices, we had one office and a broom closet. The LOALs were always the highlight of our day. Easy tickets, always polite, lots of cookies, I got a dozen hand knit accessories (scarfs, mittens, hats) when I left. 



The server keeps going down at 6AM! - /u/Arthorian
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5yrs16/the_server_keeps_going_down_at_6am/
----------------------------------------

So, this isn't my story, but a friend told me this and I wanted to share it.


So, he goes into work one day, just the usual stuff, when someone contacts him about the servers at their work and how every morning, without fail, they completely shut down at 6AM for around 15 minutes. 


So, he goes over to the place (not at 6AM) to see what was happening and check it out. After about an hour, he can't find anything wrong with it (aside from the abysmal cable management of course), so decides to come back at 6AM. 


So, the next day, he is sitting in the their office, and it 5:58AM, when the cleaner walks into the building. She walks straight up to the power sockets for the servers, unplugs one of them, and plugs in her vaccuum cleaner.



The day I force quit a company - /u/mountainwombat
https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4cpons/the_day_i_force_quit_a_company/
----------------------------------------

today I am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural area. But when I was little more than a pimply faced youth I was the technical manager of a electronics distribution company that was in the process of being swallowed up by a big multinational. It was an exciting time, complete upgrade of the network, new servers and computers, integration into a multinational system. Extra IT support staff, and I was in charge of the project from our end. Exciting times, in a very short time the project was completed, and would you believe it well under the expected time AND 35% under budget. It was even fun to complete.

Then the fun came to a crashing halt in the teleconference between us and the "executive in charge" of IT for the company that now owned us. 

I was expecting a thanks for exceeding all requirements, maybe even a small bonus. Instead I was told that the systems would all be run from new head office, and there would only be 2 IT positions to support all 5 offices across the country, all hardware support was being outsourced. The real kicker was that the positions being offered where little more than tier 1 positions to submit tickets to the hardware support company or to the head office support team. The salaries being offered was 60% less than my current  salary.

I calmly asked him to confirm that he was firing 12 people, and offering a pittance to the 2 who would remain. 

Then I simply said "No", dropped my ID and keys on the desk, picked up my coffee cup and left the building. All the it staff followed me. I never formally resigned but I think they got the idea that I was not coming back.  I got a job delivering pizza for the two months it took me to find a new IT position. I still made more money than they had offered me.

TL/DR A young IT manager has his first brush with corporate management. refuses to play the game
